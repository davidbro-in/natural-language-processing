# Natural Language Processing

## Content

### 1. Word2vec

The first jupyter notebook of this project, [`1_word2vec.ipynb`](1_word2vec.ipynb), shows the first steps while walking through Natural Language Processing. In this file, using as few libraries as possible, the implementation of Word2vec.

In [`1_word2vec.ipynb`](1_word2vec.ipynb) you can find TF, TF-IDF and cosine similarity examples.

### 2. Rule-Based Chatbot

Using DNN and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), [`2_rules_based_bot.ipynb`](2_rules_based_bot.ipynb), show a simple example of Rule-Based Chatbot. In this case, trying to board a basic customer service chatbot.

### 3. Custom embedings using [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim)
