land in nevada wow 86% thats a lot of land i wonder if they use it they should sell some of it and cover the deficit the government has yeah well most of it is desert land so i don't know. really i guess theres not much use to those lands then a man once sold the eiffel tower twice that is a great con man. how do you get away with that twice. he must have been a mastermind i know right i get it once but two times that must require a high level of skill. yeah. us now protects it workers from persecution if they go against the convention of geneva i guess thats a good thing as anyone can make mistakes and workers need to feel protecteddo you listen to the radio i do from time to time. how about you i do as well its amazing how radio waves carry info and then we are able to hear those waves tech just amazes me yeah. in canada in order to stay in operation radios are required to play 40% of canadian music i guess thats a great law it really supports local talent yeah for sure. there is a free website where you can listen to radio dramas. do you like those i do like them i will search for that site soon there is also a radiio station that transmits a news program in latin i wonder how many listeners they have. i bet they have plenty the show has been around since 1989 so they must have a good segment of people sees boring to me though i guess because we do not speak it. do you know how the radio waves are emitted no not really the science behing radios just amuse me and dont really know how they work it is a lot pf physics involved in there. it was nice chatting with you hey there partner. do you like learning about the government i think it's so fascinating to learn how various policies are enforced. i do like learning about the government. awesome. i think the ideal government should have a delicate balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority. that is certainly not the case in china where they censored the word censorship. yes i feel bad for the chinese people. i love the norwegian government for donating $1 billion to save the rain forest. that was mighty kind of them. did you know our government has shut down 17 times over the past 37 years. 3 times in 1977. that seems inefficient. kind of frustrating actually. i find it funny that wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy wikileaks. that is funny. i also find it funny that jp morgan bailed the us government out in 1895. they are probably still paying him back. lol. yes they probably are. wonder what the president's take on that is the top three wealthiest presidents of been jfk washington and jefferson. i would have thought trump would have been on that list. i would've thought so too. maybe he just needs to release some pop albums like the president of indonesia. i could see that out of trump. anything to make a little more money or get a little bit more power. lol. yeah i could definitely see him doing that. did you know the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana that is funny. lol. in guatemala close relatives of former presiedents cannot run for the presidency. i wonder if that is a good thing or bad thing a man in france impersonated a government official and manage to sell the eiffel tower twice. i wonder how much he made really that is just mind blowing to be quite honest. woodrow wilson was the only president with a phd. that is also surprising. that's very surprising indeed. in 2006 the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the geneva convention's. probably for the iraq war. im not to familiar with the geneva convention. i did know that fdr was the last president to spak a foreign language fluently. i want to know what language that was. sometimes i like listening to foreign music on the radio. it's not as easy in canada though because 40% of the music has to be canadian. i also heard that the most popular radio act in 1930s was a ventriloquist act. that is hard to believe. i don't speak latin but if i did i would listen to the program that the finland radio broadcast. it was nice talking with you today. have a great one. nice talking with you as well. have a lovely day. do you still get a chance to listen to the radio hello there i do i found a really good local station that i like how about you i do. did you know that the storms in jupiter are so strong that they can be heard on an am radio i think i have read about that before that is really amazing. i agree. were you aware that you can make a radio with very little i think so i think soldiers in wwi make them using a razorblade and a pencil. yes they did. they called them foxhole radios. good call. i think any information or any form of entertainment they could get was well welcomed. i'm sure it was. have you heard any of the old radio dramas that were very popular beforetv no i don't think i have but i do know there is a website where you can listen to tons of them for free. there is. i wonder if they still hold up i bet they do but still are dated. i think there are some real gems hidden in that bunch. you're probably right. did you know that by law 40% of music played on canadian radio has to be canadian i think i have heard about that sounds pretty funny but i bet the canadian bands like it. i would imagine so. so strange that they had to make a law. are you interested in politics at all i am not i think most of politics is just fighting to stay in position how about you i agree with you but i also think it's important so i do have an interest. did you know that until 1805 the runner up in a presidential race became the vp can you imagine that now that is very true. and yeah isn't that wild it would be a reality show for sure. it would be crazy. on the lighter side do yo know what the first president of zimbabwe was called i think he was called president banana. but i think it was because his actual name was that. he was. i'm not sure if that was his born name. are you comfortable talking about the government sure i'm up for talking about anything. what do you think of our president and our govt what do you think about the statement the people want to be kept secure and safe but don't want to know how it is done i think that it makes us guilty of all kinds of things that we might not want to take part in. we're adults. we can hear the truth. true but lately i have been growing feeling that ignorance is bliss to an extent. a bit worried where the current government is going i am worried too. too much learning on the job. the oval office should be for those with experience. too much is at stake. i kind of which they provided more qualified presidential candidates. the last elections choices were for me trying to see who was less worse. choosing presidents shouldn't be like that yes very frustrating. money has coopted the entire process. now the candidate is sold to the highest bidder. i don't have enough money to buy a meaningful vote. in regards to voting it is sad how low the voter turnout is in the us it is quite low. votes are apathetic and believe they have no faith in the system. how can that be changed i wonder. i mean other countries have 90% turnup so. i know that australia requires people to vote. that is a good way to get a govt of the people. i mean i like how the current government balanced freedom with absolute state authority but the dominance of only 2 party has lead to some issues being argued over just for the sake of a political agenda rather than the people yes the politicians serve themselves first then the people a distance second. or third. actually do they serve us i wonder if the structure in plato's republic would resolve any of our current problems philosopher king something like that i wonder. i like the lottery system of athens. well basically those who can't have can rule. but those who don't rule can have. oh no plutocracy then. renounce possessions and assets and you get the reins of power. basically ya it tries to remove any external forces that would motivate rulers to make selfish choices i guess. not sure how it would work out though i figure there would be quid pro quo not immediate but after the fact once the rule left. no way to stop corruption without watchers. but will watch them anyway great chat. same. thank you for chatting. hey there do you listen to ej radio no i never heard of it. maybe someone is trying to censor it like the chineese government censored the word censorship. apparently you can even catch jupiter's storms in the am radio i rarely listen to radio these days. such an old tech radio waves. reminds me of the cold war and voa. true. soldiers in wwii used to make radios out of razorblades and pencils that's wild. luckily hanson wasn't around then otherwise they could've been fooled into listening to them.like chicago was by a dj who did not reveal the name of the band true. i wonder though those soldiers what kind of channel they picked up with those radios maybe they picked up fdr speaking a foreign language. he was the only potus who could speak one fluently could be. do you know any latin it's all greek to me. it' like listening to a ventriloquist on the radio. yeah me too but there is a radio in finland that gives the news in latin i'm surprised they have an audience. if they're not careful they may need a government bailout.jp morgan style i guess so. but i do wonder how many people speak latin to be listening to it maybe they listen to it like music. there a station that plays the sun's music. it's solar activity translated into sound. so cool. and there is a radio station that plays free radio dramas. do you like those well life's enough of a drama for me. we got an opioid crises troops on the border white supremacists marching. yeah i guess we do not need the radio for more of that. do you know much about politics and presidents well if the government keeps shutting down there won't be much left to know. what happens if you renounce your citizenship and there's not government to leave behind that is an interesting question. did you know trump is not the wealthiest us president he's so full of debt that he may be the poorest. he has not motive for moving to monaco. yeah i guess you never know. nice chatting with you hi did you know that 86% of the land in nevada is owned by the government if they were treated like us citizens they would be forced to sell it to pay for their massive debts. yes the government does own 86% of nevada. not only that but did you hear that in 2006 the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the geneva convention why even have the geneva convention wow some con man in france sold the eiffel tower twice. yes but on the better side in 2008 the norwegian government donated $1b to help save the amazon rainforest. there's still some good left in the world. that's cool of them. that is a lot of money for norway. meanwhile the president of indonesia released 4 pop albums. i think it was 3 pop albums but i could be wrong. i did hear that wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy wikileaks. yeah 3. did you know that soldiers made radios out of razor blades and pencils in ww i yes i heard about that. did you know that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio yeah jupiter has some great stations. canada's government requires 40% of their music to be canadian. i know right since 1989 a finnish radio station has broadcast nuntii latinii a weekly news program conducted entirely in classical latin. so do you follow prince harry and ms. markle i don't get why people get so crazy about a royal couple. no i don't. prince harry and ms. markle are all over the news and are celebrities in the uk because they are royalty. i guess they visited wales. may dodged a question about inviting trump to the wedding. yes so says the british tabloids who also reported that prince harry recently sidestepped an inquiry whether the obamas could expect an invitation in their mailbox given the prince's friendship with barack obama. i didn't realize markle's mom is black and her father is white. i couldn't care less. they are going to raise their child gender neutral. i guess the big question is will the obamas be headed to windsor in may if they do i don't want to see or hear about it. i just hope they are wasting more taxpayer money on the pleasure trips. i guess harry and meghan were presented with celtic love spoons yes their ceremony at st. george's chapel in windsor which seats 800 will be filled no doubt. i'd rather visit a local pub and read up on the latest wikileaks. ha yes wikileaks. wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy wikileaks so they might be gone til then. the gov't could use a good government. thanks for the chat. hey how are you what do you think about trump i have mixed feelings i think he can do better in some aspects how about you i believe he is a disgrace and history will look poorly back on him i can't believe people buy anything he says. he puts words in peoples mouths like macron on the european military. good i agree with you lol i didn't want to say i hated him and end up you liked him lol. he sucks in my opinion. no he is a complete joke he is terrible and so are the morons that support him seriously have to be the dumbest people. i hope he does not win in 2020 otherwise im moving to new zealand ha. lol you sound like my brother matt he would say the same thing and move to new zealand also. did you see the eu members and the multinational brigades/ did you know zimbabwe's president is nicknamed president banana that is crazy do you know who angela merkel is do you like germany i just know we kicked germanys butt in both ww1 and ww2 i wonder if dee fought in ww2 dee who a famous soldier trump not sure of his name. i'm also not sure what branch he was in though. never heard of that person i will have to research him. do you listen to the radio much radio is that the technology that uses those crazy radio waves to carry information like sound and stuff yes crazy stuff. radios in am mode can potentially pick up radio storms from jupiter. oh wow i wonder what they would have to say about government it is that system or group of people that govern an organized community often called a state. i wonder if they have governments on jupiter. i think trumps new space force can bring democracy to jupiter and even mars not unless wikileaks publishes their plans to go there and colonize it. the us only brings democracy where there is oil so i'm sure there is a ton there. for sure preach it. did you know the government owns 86 percent of nevada. must be doing some experimenting there is that the area called area 69 yea it is the cooler area 51. it was nice chatting with you. i am glad that the government is back for the next three weeks. me too its a relief hope things can settle now did you hear the news about alan diaz therefore we need to hurry up for our tax refunds. what happened well it seems like he died at age 71 it can seem old but it was still surprising. what caused his death i think he dies out of natural causes what makes his famous is the picture he captured of that kid elian gonzales. what was elian gonzales known for was he a prodigy no he was a kid and alan diaz took a photo of him in a moment of distress he earned a pulitzer prize because of the photo a soldier is like pointing a gun at him and the response of the kid is of terror that is sad. every picture has a symbolism. i agree but behind every picture there is a history as well alan diaz spent a lot of time in cuba and this boosted his career. symbolism and representation of history. he risked his life out there as a photographer. he did but maybe retirement was the biggest risk he ever took as he died a few years later i think maybe retirement killed him he wanted to continue his career. why did he have to retire then i'm not sure he wanted to continue it but from personal experience once someone retires passion gets lost and that could kill you so changing the subject a bit you know that trumps guest house is bigger than the white house that is sad. to be honest his ideas are different. i don't agree with much of his ideas either i think we made a mistake when he got elected but oh well there's not much we can do now. it's ridiculous with the wall. this caused the government to shut down. imagine those people who have families need money to provide for them. i know its a terrible situation and for absurd reasons at least his not making pop albums with his time in office like the president of indonesia. speaking of pop albums i believe that kanye west is siding with trump he is well kanye isn't the best person to ask lol his had a lot of controversies during the past years. nice chatting with you. hey there what do you think of our government and constitution i think that like everything there is good and bad to it. the bad for example i find it odd that the us government owns 86% of nevada. wow that is scary good to know that norway donated 1 billion dollars to the amazon rainforest though it is nice to hear of a government doing something positive. the government can be quite complicated. usually it consists of legislature executive and judiciary. i can see how things can get very confusing very quickly. oh ya for sure imagine the complicated scheme the guy who sold the eiffel tower used he sold it not once but two times haha wow that is amazing. how can someone even manage to pull something like that and twice i know right did you hear how the gov had a plan to destroy wikileaks yeah ironically wikileaks is who published that. haha yup do you know who president banana is wasn't the president of zimbabwe called that you think that is weird did you know the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office. haha you'd think so maybe he should make a pop album he could call it president banana and vp plantain. haha that's funny. i cannot imagine how someone can run a country and release albums. i don't know how they would find the time. of course not all presidents have the same amount of power it depends on the country. yes i agree can you believe the runner up used to become the vp in the usa that is so wacky up until 1805 right i kind of wonder if that wouldn't be a better system in some ways. maybe there would be less animosity since they would be forced to work together. ya i would like to see pres trump and vp hillary it would either be hilarious or horrible haha yeah i can see the downside potentially. do you know the top 3 richest presidents btw if i remember correctly it was jfk washington and jefferson. i am surprised it was presidents from long ago and not more current. i know and i was surprised trump was not on the list very strange. can you believe that the guest house is actually bigger than the white house i would like to see that since the white house is huge. ya i need to go back and see it i only was there once back in middle school yeah i went quite a while ago as well. well it was nice chatting with you. have a good day. hello do you follow politics at all a little what would you like to start with let's start with the presidents. did you know that the top 3 wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk washington and jefferson i think that was before trump became president. yeah i was surprised trump was not on that list that list has to be from before 2016 i'm thinking it is. did you know that the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office he would fit right in here in the states. lol yeah that's funny. i wonder if you get into trouble for criticizing the the presidential music maybe get caned in indonesia oh my. lol up until 1805 the runner up in the us presidential elections automatically became the vice president. interesting. vice president clinton can you imagine it would definitely make it interesting. lol did you know that the us presidents guest house is larger than the white house now that's making guests feel at home. buttering them up. lol did you know that the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana maybe his vice prez was named apple now wouldn't that be funny. did you you know that 86% of the land in nevada is owned by the us government that pretty much leaves las vegas and reno as the only spots to live. lol yeah that's lot of desert and secret military bases no doubt. in 2008 the norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the amazon rain forest. that's a lot of money. i wonder if it helped at all. where did the money come from probably the norwegian tax payers. lol a man in france impersonated a government official and managed to sell the eiffel tower not once but twice. that's nuts. think he sold it to the same sucker that would be funny . hahaha on another cool topic before i have to get off here. jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio. that's pretty cool. i was just reading about the fox hole radios just need a razor blade and a pencil that's pretty interesting as well. that is. talk about being creative with what little you have to work with. i got to run. it's been fun chatting with you. hi did you know the president guest house is bigger than the white house no that's really wild. i wonder why that is did you know that the president of zimbabwe is named president banana haha yeah thats a very unique name. i saw that the president of indonesia has released three pop albums. do you think president banana has also done this thats pretty awesome he must have a lot of time. i wonder how many concerts he does. i have no clue if president banana has done this lol lol yeah i've never heard of him before either. do you think we should go back to the old world where the runner up of the presidential election would become the vice president maybe but not until trump is out lol i dont think him and hillary would make a good team nope at all. that is a recipe for massive drama. do you listen to the radio by the way sometimes i listen to it on my way to work yes sometimes. i usually listen to audio book or pandora though. yes i usually listen to youtube myself. but i did hear that you can listen to a radio storm from jupiter. i think it's on the am radio. i need to try that that sounds really interesting. there is a website you can listen to old classic radio dramas for free. wow have you listened to it probably would like it myself. but say that you get what you pay for haha i probably wouldnt listen to it to be honest. i hear soldiers use to make radios out of a razor blade and a pencil. thats so weird. that is crazy. it was called the foxhole radio. and i have no idea how it worked haha. i also wouldn't listen to a radio station that was broadcast in classical latin haha me either i dont speak latin but that is interesting. what do you think about the government i guess they try to destroy wikileaks or something thats interesting. i hear that the government owns 86% of nevada. yep that's what i heard too. i also heard a guy tried to sell the eiffel tower twice. that is insane haha that guy must be an amzing con artist lol oh totally. speaking of something that is not a con norway gave over 1 billion dollars to help save the amazon rainforest. that is super nice of them that is really nice of them. i really would like to visit norway one day. i would too. the whole country seems like it's full of super nice people haha. maybe i will see you there how are you today i am good but very frustrated at jeff sessions defending the child separation at the border. i know this has gotten way out of hand. apparently the concession is if you don't want to be separated from them then don't bring them. that is a horrible idea. these people come here to try to save their children from abuse and death. the washington post told sessions that separating infants and toddlers from their mothers is wrong. i agree this situation is untenable. apparently the us lost track of 1475 immigrant children in 2018. it is so traumatic for the children. there are 11000 unaccompanied children and it is taking 45 days to place them yes it is a sad state of affairs something amicable needs to be done. the aclu is fighting it they say its the worst thing they have seen in 25 plus years. well i guess we will have to wait and see. did you know that the guest house is bigger than the actual white house yes but probably smaller than margo largo. even though trump is not one of the 3 wealthiest presidents. right. it was jefferson jfk & washington. can you imagine hillary and trump together in the white house that would be pretty funny. or trump and the first president of zimbabwe president banana too funny.. i don't think i could let anyone call me banana. how about the president of indonesia having 3 pop albums that is pretty crazy. imagine listening to trump sing on the radio radios were one of the first methods of long range messaging. oh no. apparently jupiter storms are so strong that they can be picked up by am radio. wow that is crazy. i did not know you could make simple radios using a razorblade and a pencil soldiers in wwii did such things. those guys are super heroes for real. did you know that canada has a law that 40% of its music be canadian. . that's pretty funny. i prefer canadian music over the news in latin like they play in finland. i hear you. did you know that our government owns 86% of nevada. wow. that is pretty crazy. i had never heard that. some governments definitely are in favor of preservation norway gave 1 billion to help save the amazon rainforests that should have been enough to save it then. nice talking with you. did you pay much attention to all the news about prince harry and meghan markle not much i cut off my tv last year but i see them on website headlines from time to time. i guess before the wedding they went on a tour to various places including wales i think that created some drama haha. the crowds would have been crazy considering that she's a famous actress i dont know what shows she is on i heard some crime dramas and 90210. she is good looking. considering that she's now pregnant they've been all over the british tabloids for a while oh thats nice. prince harry seems like he would be a good father. i heard he had kids give meghan a group hug. people were also making a big deal about whether obama would be invited to the wedding. was he speaking of presidents did you know the first president of zimbawe was called banana that's actually his last name which is even funnier if you ask me the president of indonesia has 3 pop albums out. i heard he actually released them while he was in office too. who would have thought he would have the time did you know back in the day the runner up became vice president. i'm kind of glad that changed though with how different the political parties are oh they would be at each others throats if that happened modern day. and they would fight over the white house guest house since it's bigger than the actual white house well if i were one of the wealthiest like jfk washinton or jefferson i would build my own white house haha. i don't think the white house was built yet while washington was president. the government has definitely changed over the years though they still own 86% of nevada good point.did you know that washington would be a half a billionaire in todays money though i am sure he had a nice pad. mount vernon is a place you can still tour today. it's a whole plantation. nice talking with you hey did you know the university of iowa painted the rival team's locker room pink haha i guess it's meant to psych out the opposition. how many home games have they won though talent wins. haha thats what i want to know personally i think that would make me play better because i'd be mad haha times have really change for sports. in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars. does anyone watch bowling now maybe the u of iowa would paint the other team's lanes pink or something. ya that's a good point maybe the pros will paint their bowling ball pink as well haha i guess the highest football score ever was 222 0 isn't that crazy georgia tech crushed cumberland. did the gt coach put in the third string did he have money riding on the game or something was there a pink lockerroom involved haha those are all great questions ya i think after like 100 0 i would definitely just give up there's no coming back maybe they should paint their football pink espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line showing the first down line for american football games. was it weak field of emmy contestants that year or something the u of iowa would want a pink line for the visiting team. haha i would like to see that on tv people that create things are always interesting like the guy who created the football huddle he was deaf and did it to prevent the opposing team from seeing his hand signs improvise. adapt. overcome. there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl. i wonder why that is. is it unusual to play qb from that side thats a good question what i want to know is does that give him an advantage disadvantage or probably it doesnt matter do you listen to music sure. do you follow dance at all tupac the rapper danced ballet in high school. he played the mouse king in the nutcracker. not really in line with his image as a gangsta. haha no that sounds like it would have been a wild performance to see i wonder what kind of music babies like best apparently they will dance and smile when they hear a beat music is fundamental to our psyche. i wish dance were the same. ya i'm bad at dancing definitely not as good as bruce lee who apparently won a dance competition back in 1958 he could kick it on the dance floor and in the dojo. professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes a week. i wonder how many bruce went through in a week. that's a good question i used to date a ballerina and ya he does were really messed up all that dancing will affect your shoes and also your feet it's tough on your body. i've never been attracted to doing ballet. but i understand that it's challenging. ya also tough on your body is the michael jackson leaning device that he used it used wires and apparently jackson has a patent on it it was a clever illusion. quite convincing. well i enjoyed chatting with you. have a good night. thank you you too. keep looking for that tupac ballet tape i want to see it. hello do you have a favorite football quarterback yes my favorite football qb is aaron rodgers. ah mine is probably tom brady although a lot of americans also like him how much longer before tom brady retires i am not sure do you know i also wanted to point out that the only left handed quarterback in the nfl is kellan moore really is kellan moore the only left handed quarterback what tean does he play for he has played a total of six seasons for the cowboys and the detroit lions. oh i did not know that. did he ever start a game i am not sure. the circular huddle used in the nfl was invented so the opposing team could not see the hand signals. wow thats amazing. did you know the highest score in a football game ever was 222 0 i feel very bad for the team that lost by 222 points. it was georgia tech that defeated cumberland right yes it was. you have such good football knowledge. which football quarterback has the most consecutive starts i am actually not sure on that one. was it tom brady i am not sure who was it well it was brett favre. did you know bruce lee was a great dancer i never imagined bruce lee to be a dancer until i learned that he won the kong cha cha championship back in 1958. did you know when bruce lee was a baby he would spontaneously dance when he heard music and he smiled more when he hit the beat no i did not. professional ballet dancers can go through up to four pairs of ballet shoes a week. that is true. did you know tupac danced ballet in high school he was a ballet dancer that portrayed the mouse king in the nutcracker right that is right. i never would have thought that tough ex gang member rapper tupac danced ballet. michael jackson has a patent on a device that can be used to achieve a lot of lean. was that a lean he did in some of his dance moves yep i was always wondering how he achieved those. what is the most popular sport in the world i belive that it is soccer (or football) that is correct. have you ever played soccer i sometimes do. what about you no but i have played football. ah so have i. anyways i have to go now. thank you for the wonderful chat. hi do you like to dance even babies spontaneously dance when music is played for them. yes. i am not a big dancer. i think that as we age we lose a lot of our childlike joy in things. perhaps i do still like a lot of childhood things. i am still a big fan of bruce lee who was also a great dancer. i am a big fan of bruce lee as well. he won a dance championship in the 50's. his movements were so graceful. yes the 1958 cha cha championship. good times. have you ever taken a dance class ballet is beautiful. dancers can go though 4 pairs of their pointe shoes in a week. that's a lot of shoes. i never had the opportunity to take classes probably because i played a lot of football as a quarterback. football is my favorite sport. did you enjoy playing qb how many years did you play i played for 4 years in high school. it was fun but high stress the qb involved in pretty much every offensive play and lets face it no one cares about defense. unless you are on the defense. i think it is amazing that tom brady had such a slow start to his career. yeah they didn't even start him once on his high school team. yes. and not at first in college either. never give up on your dreams. very inspiring. do you like the redskins i do i have been to rfk stadium before. it was a long time ago. i have been to fed ex field not rfk. alex smith is one of my favorite qb's. he started college as a junior. sad about his injury this year. yeah that's too bad. i think part of the reason i gave up on football was i never had a fair shot because i'm left handed. even now there is only 1 left handed qb in all of the nfl. yes that is statistically odd. when did the redskins move to the new field hmm it was 1997 when they moved into fedex field. high school players sometimes get to play on pro fields like rfk stadium. did you ever get to do that as qb no unfortunately not. i remember when the old rfk hosted a triple header of hs games. it would have been so cool to play on that field. something magical about that. i have been down on the broncos field and in arizona. football fields have a lot of tradition associated with them. yes. anyways i should go. it was nice talking to you. you too. take care. thanks radford hit a crazy final shot to get into the ncaa tournament agree do you watch ncaa men's basketball tournament i love the ncaa tournament i fill out a bracket every year for it. i also like tappan zee he is a smart player i think tappan zee is actually a high school team they recently lost on a crazy play. yes and also mcgarvey also played safety during football season and he played excellent pass defense in making the interception who payed very good mcgarvey's football skills really helped him on that play. he's been getting a lot of attention after that. yes i totally agree with you. who is your favorite quarterback i like matt ryan do you like football yes i like one interesting fact did you know that bruce lee was also a great dancer and he won the hong kong cha cha championship in 1958 wow i didn't know bruce lee was a dancer. i only knew him as a great martial artist. yes a really great actor. also michael jackson has a patent. on a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves. so interesting michael jackson is amazing. tupac was actually a great dancer too. really i couldn't even imagine. i love him so much he is the greatest. so what country football you prefer the most i only watch american football what about you me too but some years ago i was watching italian football as well and spanish. did you know that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars that's crazy football players make much more now. yes exactly and also espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games. i love that line makes it much more enjoyable to watch yes agree with you. can you believe that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 0 this is so funny how is that even possible lol yes i live in atlanta that team is very close to me i actually knew that. hi i am a huge football fan. we love the packers. how about you hello i watch some football im not a huge fan. i like the niners. did you know that in the 60's top bowlers made almost twice as much as football players noway. i never heard that but totally believe it. i am a huge college football fan too we love ou. i dont know what that is. oklahoma university is the college team we follow. we watched baker mayfield play all the way through school. it was a lot of fun watching him get better every season. i am more of a bowler in terms of ability. oh nice. have you ever visited the university of iowa's opposing team locker room no we have never traveled that far before apparently it is painted pink lol ha that is hilarious. it must be to get into their heads before the games start. i love it. ya know the highest game ever scored was 222 0. crazyhuh that sounds embarrassing lol yeah that would be a nightmare. i don't think they would allow that today for the sportsmanship of the game. did you know theres only one left handed quarterback i never knew that wow. i had noticed that dance is similar to football in terms of being choreographed. dancers like bruce lee used it in their film and enter competitions too. yeah i cant believe he won a cha cha competition. i know it what a weird fun fact about him.lol i learned recently that michael jackson had a patent on shoes for his dancing. oh thats cool im sure michael jackson has a lot of patents on his moves and clothing lol did you see that series that came out leaving neverland no i really want to see that though just out of curiosity. another singer that was also a dancer was tupac. he was in the ballet nutcracker n high school. it was devastating i cant get it out of my mind. yeah i did hear that that is pretty awesome. ha yeah people and their path to fame is crazy. the ou qb baker mayfield was going to become a professional gamer and not pursue football at one point. that is scary. thanks for the fun chat i really enjoyed it. great chatting. you too have a good one. when i think of football i think of american gridiron football. what do you think of i think its a great sport i like it and find it really engaging do you have like a favorite team i guess i like the patriots. i find it helps to root for a winning team. patriots rb benjarvus green ellis has never fumbled a football in the nfl. i like the patriots as well and he was a great player i became a fan of the team because of him have you ever watched australian rules football or rugby while these are called football they are faster and more painful to play. i have watched rugby and think its a nice sport as well i also like dancing rugby is a sport for the strong. dancing is very helpful to all kinds of athletes. bruce lee won the honk kong cha cha championship in 1958. i agree rugby requires strengh and dance requires agility so bruce lee not only was a martial arts champion but also a skilled dancer he sure was full with suprices its is kind of neat how dance means one thing depending on culture and football means one thing depending on culture. and yet bruce lee danced the cha cha. it is neat do you like ballet i knew some one who was in a high school version of the nutcracker. they were no tupac but they liked it. i do not. i see its amazing how much shoes a pro dancer has to buy 4 pairs a week yes it looks painful as well. i wonder if a pro ballet dancer makes more than a top bowler some sports stars make lots of money. in the 1960's bowlers made more than football stars. i guess football wasn't so popular back then pro players make a lot of money now i bet quarterbacks are one of the highest paid players the leader of the offensive team and the player that touches the ball almost every offensive play yep they deserve top money. do you know who tom brady is he is the patriots qb. in high school he was a backup player and never played a game. thats crazy the coach didnt know he had a hall of famer in the bench they had a terrible season i bet that made brady work harder to make it to the starting team the competition between players must be fierce or maybe brady never wanted to start in high school. save himself for the big time. baker mayfield is competitive in games like halo 3 and thinks of becoming a full time gambler. i heard he considered quitting football once to pursue a gaming career i think he made the right decision in financial terms it is a bit of a gamble to enter any career. let alone one where you throw forward passes. i see your point players can get injured easily in the field so its a tough call some injuries end careers. hi do you watch the nfl i sure do . do you have a favorite position in the game i like the qb and you me too. did you know brady was a backup qb that never got started n high school yeah that was big mistake on their behalf as the guy is awesome you bet it was. do you know who alex smith is yes he is a qb who is also super smart and finished college in two years yeah he planned ahead by taking lots of ap tests smart kid yes. do you know who invented the circular huddle yes that was paul hubbard who was deaf and did not want the other team to understand what he was saying yeah smart guy. baker mayfield wanted to become a professional gamer and quit football yes he still claims to be really good at halo 3 yeah and the thinks that he can beat anyone at u of oklahoma at it wow good for him i guess. do you know who kellan moore is yes he is the only left handed qb in the nfl right now i wonder if he has any advantages for that fact over the others i wonder too. do you like baseball i like it too . do you know why the managers wear uniforms that is because they can play of they team needs them to yes. do you know what kickball is called in canada yes it is called soccer baseball hello. do you like football are ready for the super bowl i hope we have a good game like the football game that occurred in 1916 when the score was 222 0. georgia tech vs. cumberland. i am ready and really exited my team is playing so i am really looking forward to it and that would be really unusual well i am sure there will be a lot of scoring. not like the junipero serra high school jv football team that had a bad season. they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown. the whole time they had tom brady on his team but never properly used him. that seems like a big waster imagine having a hall of famer and one of the best qb in history and not using them i guess thats why they lost. yes bad coaching. well another interesting fact about football is that alex smith was very smart that he got his bachelor's degree in only two years and was working on a master's degree before being number one pick for the 2005 nfl draft. wow most players just decide to go pro and dont worry about studies that is really admirable. so true. well kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl. really the only one i wonder why that is maybe left handed players aren't as skilled in football. don't they say left handed people are more artsy right handed ben jarvus green ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career. could be but it doesnt look like for the qb position and that is a great record not fumbling he must be the only player. well just like football baseball has a lot of interesting facts. did you know that kickball is also called soccer baseball canada. i didnt know that that is an interesting fact just like why the managers also wear uniforms yes. or the fact that baseball is popular in japan that many fans are surprised to discover its status as america's national pastime. i wonder if they also collect cards in japan its crazy how much those cards are worth at least the rare ones. rare baseball cards are worth a lot. a man once found three million dollars worth 1900s baseball cards in his grandfather's attic. that's incredible. he sure was a lucky man imagine finding that much money in your attic he was very lucky. i also think the married couple who scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games were also lucky to be given such a job. they did this until 2005. that sure sounds like a lot of work for only two people 2430 are a whole bunch of games that is a large amount just like when the top bowler's in the 1960s made twice as much as top football stars. i wonder why they made more maybe football wasnt popular at the time and bowling was. well it was the 1960's so it is understandable that more people liked to watch bowling. anyways it was nice chatting with you. hi how are you doing today do you like sports i like sports i like all forms of football even canadian football. i dont know canadian football. is it good is it polite lol it is like the nfl but with small differences. do you like the nfl i do but i dont get to watch very much. maybe the super bowl. can you believe that there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl do you think there is a bias no i think that maybe there is something about the sport that attracts righties to that position. i think some great lefties have played qb in the past though. yeah but do you think plays are drawn for right handed qb and left handed qb might have some difficulties with them yes that is a possibility. i guess that the blockers might have to switch around too. like left handed pitcher have a advantage because people are not used to them. do you like baseball i do like baseball. i try to watch the playoffs and the series. it is special i think it is the only sport that the manager can play for their team if they need it that is why they wear a uniform. that must be a holdover from the old days. i bet a player was chosen as manager. then there was a leader on the field. baseball is an old sport they had baseball cards in the 1900s they are worth millions now. i would love to find a trove of those cards. i would sell some and keep the rest. what would you do i would sell them all and invest in something. but if they were my grandfather's i would to the same as you. yes the cards can appreciate but i would like to invest as well. but if it was a family heirloom i would have some sleepless nights. i would want to keep some but at the same they are worth a lot. i could keep the worthless ones. true it is hard to part with things that have been in the family. anyway great chat. you too thanks for the conversation. i hope the playoffs will be good. have a great day. yes me too. bye did you hear about the oklahoma quarterback and the heisman trophy he won yes. it was kyler murray from oklahoma yeah the same one he is really skilled and now is on the top of college football i hope he does well in the nfl he also was drafted by the oakland a's for baseball in 2018. i see it must be hard to win the heisman trophy he had 40 touchdowns in the season that is amazing i would love to have that kind of talent. gives him a lot of options. it does i bet every team wants him in their roster quarterbacks are the most important player in the team i agree. his uncle calvin murray also played baseball for the san francisco giants. did he i guess football runs in his family do you like tom brady yes. i didn't like him early in his career but a few years ago he changed my mind. speaking of qb's browns qb baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue competitive gaming full time. i heard he has some crazy halo skills he is pretty good he beat everyone at his university that's crazy. there's only 1 left handed qb in the nfl . kellan moore. i didn't know that. the only one i bet his good do you also like baseball love baseball. that's my favorite sport. did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they technically are able to play for their teams if they are needed i didnt know that it would be interesting to watch a manager play and win the game they must remain fit just in case you're right. baseball is also really popular in japan. it is there was a man that found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards he found them in his attic crazy right i wish i could have that kind of luck. baseball is also called america's national pastime but i think that has long since been passed by football basketball and video gaming. i agree how hard can it be to organize baseball games a couple scheduled all of the 2430 mlb games for 24 years wow. i don't think i would want to do that job. if i did i would schedule the first month of the season to be played in either in either domes/stadiums with a retractable roof or have the teams play in the warmer southern states. sometimes april games isn't ideal to play baseball in the crummy weather. it must be a hard job for just two people anyway sports are great im glad they exist. hi how are you today i guess the family has been a sporting family and not just in football do you like football can you believe the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink. lol i bet they do that for mental intimidation wow i never knew that. i am not a big sports person. i guess many people love football. how about you yes i like it but its not my favorite. have you ever been to a football game lol i have never been to one. have only gone to a baseball game. you should try to go to one someday. canaada only has 1 professional team i will try some time. can you believe that in the 1960's bowlers were paid 2x as much as football players. a lot has changed since then. they make a lot of money now. wow yes thats amazing. dis you also knowbaseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises. i never knew that. i never knew that either. i can not recall seeing a manager ever play before but it may have happened. there is a lot i do not know about sports and sports trivia. do you have any baseball card that man found 3million dollars of old cards wow... lol i am not sure if its happened or not. i wish i could run into something worth a lot of money. i hope for that. yes i do too. i find old things at times but they are never worth any thing at all. wish my grandfather had saved his baseball cards. so is american and canadian football the same no not really. i am learning though. do you like soccer nothing about soccer in the articles. do not know anything about it. did you know that baseball was popular in japan thats interesting. sorry my mistake. what else do u know i see that many people think the quarterbacks are the the leader of the offensive team. i guess they do a lot in a game. yea each member definately the quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes. so did you know who kyler murray was before reading the article i never heard of him. i am so out of touch with some things. nope lol and i still am not sure i did not read that part either. it has been good talking to you. i enjoyed taking to you and learning some sport trivia and facts. merry christmas hey there can you guess the 3 richest presidents in history i can they are jfk washington and jefferson. did you know that until 1805 in the u.s. the runner up in a presidential election became the vice president. haha didn't know that imagine vp hillary right now. there would be even more drama. kind of happy thats not that case still that's probably why that's not how things work anymore. i think that hilary would have kept trump maybe a little more in line. speaking of trump though did you hear that he made up how many people watched his state of the union address. ah yeah i did hear that i'm also shocked that he lives in teh white house and not the guest house the guest house is apparently bigger. that is a strange but true fact. apparently he has been making up numbers for all sorts of things. back in 2010 he made up numbers for how well the apprentice was doing. ah i see do you watch a lot of tv i used to watch pokemon as a kid i watch a fair share and pokemon is a show that my children love. did you know that there is over 750 episodes of pokemon. thats crazy. even if i watched 50 a year for 16 years id probably never catch em all. haha very clever. another animated show that i used to watch as a kid was the simpsons. i can't believe there has been one episode where bart wasn't in it and wasn't even mentioned. no that is shocking did you watch that south park episode where they roasted family guy that is crazy but what is crazier is that the simpsons crew sent flowers to the producers. haha ya lets just say south park did a great job their analysis was spot on haha that was definitely spot on unlike that 70's show remake days like these that was cancelled after only 10 episodes. yup i guess humor is different across theh pond do you like robin williams at all who doesn't he was such an amazing actor. another amazing actor though is alec baldwin and he narrated some thomas the tank episodes which is really cool. that is cool i don't know about ringo starr i'm not sure why they had him narrate i don't even know what he sounds like i agree i'm not sure how he would sound but he did act in a movie called caveman so i'm guessing he made a decent thomas the train. ah i see i'll have to look at that do you think any of them got to go to the secret celebrity room at pixar studios maybe not them but probably robin williams. it's crazy that robin williams was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated movies. ya he kicked off a trend thats for sure did you know judge judy makes 120k an episode now there is a job i want. that is crazy but it's probably not easy to get into doing that. it's probably easier to just become a regular judge. i can't believe that she's one of the highest paid celebrities. no me neither only second to lebron james apparently hey how's it going what are your thoughts on the trump administration so far he definitely may go down as one of the wealthiest. the top 3 wealthiest are jfk washington and jefferson. it is hard for me to imagine any president to be richer than trump but i guess adjusted for inflation washington and jefferson are right up there yeah true. at least trump isn't a pop artist. the president of indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office lol. that is some serious multitasking. of course some countries the president really does not have much power. more ceremonial true. kind of like the king/queen of england. the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana i wonder why maybe he liked bananas. or maybe he was tall and skinny haha yes maybe. do you watch a lot of tv south park was a funny show for me. it seems like the south park creators and the simpsons crew were all pretty close. i imagine there is a mutual respect. both shows have been on the air for multiple decades. yes very true. i always thought it would be nice to be a celebrity. make so much money. judge judy makes 123000 per episode. wow that is impressive. i wonder how many episodes she makes per year. i know the big bang theory cast makes around 1 million per show holy cow that must be nice. it is always sad when celebrities commit suicide like robin williams. he did the genie voice in aladdin and was the first actor to do that. man i miss robin williams. watching the trailer for the will smith version of aladdin was so disappointing. he looked like a smurf on steroids. same. i agree so weird. hopefully they won't ruin it. pixar studios has a secret room only for celebrities. i wonder whats inside. maybe sneak peaks of new pixar movies. or just lots of buzz lightyear toys. yeah i bet you're right. it is odd how so much money and wealth some countries have. whereas in others they are so poor. an ethiopian celebrity chef believes he can combat world hunger. i hope so. i bet people in ethiopia have to be more creative with food. they have to find a way to make all their food last and not be wasteful. yes use every bit of it. i love when celebrities try and do good. carol burnette was the first celebrity to appear on the childrens series sesame street. i love carol burnett. i bet she had a great time goofing off with elmo and big bird. haha yes i bet she did. i wonder how different our world would be if we didn't associate celebrities with wealth then they probably would not be celebrities. they would just be regular people yeah i think our society would be a lot different if we didn't put so much importance on these people. i think it would be good to focus on other things like ending world hunger. some celebrities use their wealth and fame to support worthwhile causes. are you a fan of trump hi. i certainly can't believe he isn't one of the three wealthiest presidents of all time as that was jefferson washington and jfk. what about you not at all but i do believe jfk was one of the wealthiest his family comes from money. agreed. since we're on the subject of presidents can you believe that the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana i knowhow about the president of indonesia having not 1 but 3 pop albums he must be onr popular musician right and here in america the president's guest house is actually bigger than the white house itself. i didn't even know the president had a guest house. why in the world would it be bigger than the actual white house though you know can you see hillary and trump in the white house together there was a rule in 1805 that required it. there would be sheer chaos if that rule was still in place considering how divided the country is. it would be like a living south park episode. speaking of south park are you a fan i love how the simpson's crew sent the south park producers flowers after they aired the family guy episode. that was nice of them. i must not watch it enough because when i heard that they did that i thought they were bring flowers to the funeral of the show lol. ha. that's hilarious. do you watch the simpson's at all there's actually one episode where bart never makes an appearance nor is even mentioned that i still want to see. i do bet it's weird never seeing bart at all. yeah that would have been weird since they never mentioned him. still can't compare to 750 episodes of pokeman. no kidding. 750 episodes and yet the uk remake of 70s show lasted only ten episodes. that's kind of sad really. it is but nobody does it like we do. apparently there was a few celebrities that narrated thomas the tank engine. oh yeah. it was alec baldwin ringo starr and george carlin. they each narrated at least 52 episodes. i kind of want to go back and rewatch it just to see if i recognize their voices. ha. right. do you know about pixar's secrete room i've heard that it's often visited by celebrities. it's too bad we'll probably never see that room unless we miraculously become celebrities somehow. ha. honestly i'm not sure i want to see it that sounds to weird. no telling what they are worshiping down there. you are right about that. well speaking of celebrities i never knew until recently that the first celebrity that appeared in sesame street was carol burnett. i'd like to see that episode now. wow i love carol she was in a movie called annie. times have certainly changed. indeed it has. can you also believe judge judy is the highest paid celebrity behind lebron making $123k per episode that is shocking. wow but she is funny. celebrity status is usually associated with money. do you think that's true i would say wealth along with fame media attention lifestyle and even controversial actions. but fame often provides chances to earn revenue to be honest. well it was great chatting with you today. have a great evening friend. you too my friend don't go to pixar secrete room lol. ha. maybe if we ever get famous we can. but i'd stick to combating hunger problems in ethiopia similar to the celebrity chef who believes encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods can end hunger over there. ha. take care friend. do you know much about the president or have any interesting facts i know the top three wealthiest presidents were washington jefferson and jfk. nice. i wonder if trump is now part of that list i'd bet not. doubt he has that much in liquid assets. but maybe he could build his wealth by releasing some pop albums like the president of indonesia. really lol up until 1805 the runner up in the us presidential elections automatically became the vice president. that would be a nightmare nowadays. can you imagine hillary and trump sharing the white house haha. haha be good entertainment. lol the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana. lol i wonder if that was his given name the president's guest house is larger than the actual white house. that's sorta crazy. i guess they probably host a lot of people at a time. i bet you're right. do you watch a lot of television yeah too much probably. did you know there are over 750 episodes of pokemon that's close to 50 episodes a year for 16 years. i believe it as much kids have been watching it for about that long. lol true. there is only one episode of the simpsons without bart in it. wonder which one it is we'll have to look it up. did you ever watch thomas the tank no but my kids did. i remember it having a lot of guest narrators. yes. ringo starr george carlin and alec baldwin have narrated thomas for at least 52 episodes each. that's really cool. in england they made a verbatim remake of that 70's show. seems like a lot of jokes would get lost in translation. i think i've heard of that show. it was called days like these ah probably why it was canceled after 10 episodes. haha. yes. lol did you know that carol burnett was the first celebrity to appear on sesame street that's cool. wonder what year that was i started watching around 1976 when i was 1 or 2. robin williams was the first celebrity to be in a disney animated movie which set the trend. i'm not sure what year. i grew up in the 70s too. that must have been when did aladdin it was nice chatting with you. hi do you know much about presidents no not really i dont follow politics much do you have any cool facts you would like to share with me the president of indonesia is not just that but also a pop star is he really a pop star it would be fun to watch trump become a rockstar or a pop star i would pay to see that hahaha i know. yeah the guy has already released three albums three albums wow he must be really talented guatemala has a rule against family of former presidents running for office what are your thoughts on this law i am not sure in one hand it prevents nepotism but on the other hand might deny someone really talented i think that this law can prevent authoritarian regimes so it has a plus side as well yeah that is true for sure. do you know how the vice president used to be elected no not really how did the vice president used to get elected it was just the runner up. if that applied now clinton would be holding that position thank god the system is different now there would be so much trouble in the white house fights every day yup pretty much. on another topic do you watch nfl i do i love football do you have a favorite team i do not but just watch the games sometimes. did you know women can play too i didnt know that. so a woman can actually step in a superbowl game that would be interesting to watch i think it would be interesting too would like to see that. i am sure they can last the whole 11 minutes of game play who knows it might be a game changer the first nfl playoff game was played back in the year 1932 its been a long time since then it sure has. still though engineers seems to make in their lifetime more than football players that seems like an odd fact football players make a lot of money they are crazy rich yeah but i guess their careers are shorter too so maybe that levels it. nice chat. did you know that john f. kennedy was the wealthiest president yeah along with jefferson and washington well taking into account inflation i wonder where the current president would rank on wealthlies list. i am not sure about that actually. did you know the president of indonesia is a pop star no i did not. i guess our country is not the only one who has a president with a unique background. yeah that is true. this guys has already release 3 albums i am a big football fan but i did not realize the average nfl games has only 11 minutes of live action. yeah and yet we are glued to the tv for so long. did you know women can play too wow. are there any special restriction for woman playing in the nfl not that i know if as long as you make the cut i guess you can play do you think it is stupid that saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a saint player comes in i find that so strange and sexist they need to get rid of that rule i agree. here's a strange fact kicking is legal in volleyball. yeah i used to play in high school and we were allowed to do that.do you know where it was invented not sure i would guess in america yes at the ymca along with basketball that makes sense as they both can be played on the same court. i believe the women's net in volleyball is a little lower than the men's. yeah. fedex once returned a volleyball that had washed up after the tsunami in japan interesting i wonder where that ball washed up exactly hawaii perhaps maybe i really have no idea. did you know engineers make more in the lifetime than football players that didn't see right until i realized some football players aren't paid a ransom and engineers have a much longer career than football players yes i think that is what helps them earn more. nice chatting with you ) do you like the brand nike i do. there was a big stand against them with the football player colin kaepernick. do you i like the brand i think that nike took the right stand police shootings is a oncerning matter it really is. i think some people took the message wrong. sales spiked days after the ad was made i think it back fired truett mcconnel university will no longer offer nike products in the campus store and im guessin its not the only college or institution to do that i'm sure your right. the northern georgia community of cleveland doesn't off them anymore either also the college of ozarks it seems like many people have opposing views and dont agree with kaepernick and with nike yes the volleyball team even switched to gray t shirts until replacements came in theres also a bright side to this campaing and its that online sales spiked so its hard to analyze if it was a good marketing strategy tmu wants nike to the law enforcement. i think its a raise to awareness many people are taking it out of context players have the right to protest as well i dont agree with tmu its freedom of speech speaking of freedom of speech. do you watch allot of the presidential stuff i do i think its important to keep updated on current events like what the president is up to and all did you know the only president to have a phd was wilson i did not know that wilson was pretty smart he was a great leader trump has a guest house that is bigger than the white house thats an interesting fact that has to be huge. 5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote. trump was one of them that is a sure thing the first president of zimbawe had a really funny name what was the name president lincoln was the first president to be photographed. canaan banana and was he lincoln is one of my favorite presidents too bad booth killed him in a cowardly way yes booth was in the picture that he was photographed in. that is crazy. having a photo with your killer hi how are you doing do you like to watch football on the tv of course i do yeah what about you i do not get the chance to watch much. i like to watch around the playoffs. i see well the playoffs are the most exciting games 32 teams 2 divisions and the patriots seem to get to the superbowl every year the patriots. do they cheat a lot how do they win all the time they just have a great coach and a legendary coach both are the pillars of that team who is the coach i guess he must be a shrewd tactician to win every year. bill belichick is his name and yeah he is a really smart man the qb is legendary as well the qb is the most important player as far as i know. who is this qb the qb is tom brady and yeah i agree the qb has a great responsibility the qb must get paid a lot of money. is tom brady the highest paid player on the team i bet he is he is the mvp of the team and they know it so it seems fair to compensate him properly that's good. it is a dangerous job to be qb. i figure he needs money for his life after football. well his wife earns more money than him so i guess he is set for life wow she must be an amazing qb. what team does she play for shes not a qb lol shes a model or was a model although there are no rules against females playing the game maybe she is as skilled as brady perhaps brady should have become a model. there is more money in it and it is not dangerous. i agree football is a career with many hazards brain damage injuries yes it is a dangerous game. anyway i have enjoyed chatting immensely. thank you for your teachings on the football. i love the game hope things get better for players though i do too. have a glorious day. have a nice day enjoy football and brady while they last. do you own a car yup i own a car and i love it. helps me get from point a to point b. hard to believe cars didn't always exist. for sure what did they do without cars lol. do you know where the word trunk came from i believe it originated from the fact that cars used to have actual wooden trunks on the back. kind of funny to imagine. that is true i wonder if people broke into trunks easily lol. i owned a cadillac before have you had one i bet it was super easy to break in lol. i never have. but i think it's cool that the brand was named after the person who founded detroit. for sure i think his name was antoine de la mothe cadillac sounds so french. sounds very french indeed. if you lived in south africa would you put flamethrowers on your car i would totally. if i wanted a death warrant. lol ha ha. it is actually legal there because it helps the deter carjackings. they should make that a thing everywhere if they make it safe enough. do you ever go to the mcdonalds drive thru yes and other restaurants too. i think it's cool that the drive through originated to accommodate soldiers who are not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their fatigues. right that is some good respect for them and definitely helped with business. do you like our current president i think he has done some good things and some bad things. he is definitely one of the wealthiest president and think he will lead jfk washington and jefferson in terms of wealth. yea if only he will release how much he is really worth lol. he has done some good things i will agree. he needs to release a pop album like the president of indonesia then everyone will love him. that would be epic. i also wonder why the presidents guest house is larger than the white house i heard that before i wonder if it is to make a good impression for the guests from other countries you could be right on that one. the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana lol. i don't know how i feel about that lol. it was so nice chatting with you. haha that is surprisingly fitting. luckily the runner up doesn't become the vice these day otherwise it would be trump clinton. great talking with you too bye. yikes that would have to be a reality show lol. have a good weekend. hello do you own a car i've had one for a couple years. same although my car was second hand. what about your car i got a decent minivan right now but have been meaning to get a cadillac. ah i just have your standard canary. it is legal in south africa to equip your car with a flame throw. insane right that's crazy you know the brand cadillac that i want to buy it was named after a french explorer. really wow i also want a car named after me. the trunk of your called is called a trunk because old cars used to attach wooden trunks onto the back of them. did you find all these facts on the internet there are tons of information there. i do the world wide web. google is the largest search engine followed by youtube. it's crazy to think that this all started in the early 1990s. yep. the three horizontal lines on the menu of apps are called the hamburger button. speaking of hamburgers did you hear america's most recent president bought burgers for a college football team. and.. that would be trump. i heard that trump loves burgers and consumes up to 12 diet cokes a day. there was a president called president banana once i wonder if he liked diet coke. ah yeah the first president of zimbabwe. who knows i don't know but lots of presidents have weird facts like the president of indonesia that released 3 albums while in office. yes he must have been very good at multitasking. the wealthiest us president is no longer jfk but is now trump. oh really he should do something about the white house's size. the guest house is bigger than it. are you a republican or a democrat i normally vote for whichever president gives best economic reforms. based on what i saw on the internet i think i align with democrats more. ah same with me although i also do sometimes vote for the republicans. i respect your opinion even though i have different views. have a nice day. hi there. do you use the internet a lot haha only just about all day every day. same here. did you know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button i did not. so weird. i know that constant novelty from clicking links on the internet can cause real addiction measurable in the brain. oh oh.i might have that then. lol ohh me too. i find it funny that only 7% of people read the full terms and conditions when buying a product or service on the internet. i think i've been guilty of that a few times as well when i've bought some small things like dvds cds etc. from amazon. there is 3g cell service and internet at the peak of mt. everest. they're getting it everywhere now. i'm sure i'm in the same boat. i would not have guessed service was so vast. the current library of alexandria has saved a copy of the internet in case the internet burns down. that's good they have a backup plan. lol do you know a lot about cars i love cars. the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when karl benz patented his benz. nice. i didn't realize they came out that early. i wonder when cars first became available to average ordinary every day people i think cars came into global use during the 20th century. one of the first widely available was the 1908 model t. nice. i do know that the trunks of cars are called that because in the old days cars used to carry wooden trunks on the back of them. that is really cool. i can't imagine trying to get groceries and things into a wooden trunk. i know. lol did you know that the cadillac was named after the french explorer antoine de la mothe cadillac he was also the founder of detroit. no i did not. i do like cadillac. did you know mcdonald's added the drive thru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while in fatigues interesting. i wondered when they added those. i was surprised to see what mcdonalds used to look like in that movie called the founder. i don't think i've seen that movie. is it about people in the army no. it stars michael keaton and is about the founder of mcdonalds. he kind of stole the company out from the 2 brothers who created it. he actually paid them a good price for it. just basically they weren't smart businessmen and got ripped off. michael keaton's character turned into a mega company. do you follow presidential history oh i wanted to go see that. now i'll have to. i do follow presidential history. do you i do. i didn't know that the us presidents guest house was bigger than the white house. it's been fun chatting with you. definitely see that movie. really interesting to see mcdonald's was in the early days of it. it is very interesting. nice chatting with you as well. bye now. have a good one. do you listen to the radio yes i love the old radio classics.how about you i do too interesting fact but theres a weekly news program in latin its been on for 30 years so it must have a lot of fans oh wow thats cool. i really like this website that plays the old classics for absolutely free. i like to that in between listening to the canadian channel. have you heard of it i havent heard of the canadian channel only canadian music and news there yeah its funny because in canada they created a law that says 40% of the time canadian music must be played. i listen to it sometimes for fun. its amusing. i guess thats a great law promotes local talent and all there is station that picks up jupiter radio storms its an am frequency noway jupiter storms cool deal. i watch a lot of tv too. i like south park and the family guy. do you watch any shows like the simpsons yeah it must be really cool and i do like the simpsons the show just makes me laugh every time me too. there's only one show that bart is not on nor does he speak on it. the simpsons crew also sent flowers to the family guy crew for thier finale episode. that's nice to see celebrities getting along. lol it is nice both shows are really great did you ever watch pokemon no what is pokemon about well its a kids show about catching anymals with pokeballs these animals are called pokemons and then the show has duels between pokemons and they also evolve its actually cool oh okay that sounds super cool. i like that alot. i usually watch the show thomas the train with my kids.lol that show had great narrators alec balwin ringo starr both have great voices yeah right. that is one reason i really like that show even though its a kids cartoon. i like when famous people add voices to a show because it makes it sound more professional. yeah i guess little kids dont care about narrators did you watch that 70's show i have seen it a couple of times. i am a huge fan of the actors on the show but dont know much about the plot or the story line really. i see well it was a great show i think it premiered back in the year 2003 well the show was so successful the uk tried to make a remake but it was terrible noway wow. that is funny and i like the story. i need to call someone about work. the area code is new york and the reason it is 212 is because it was the fastest to dial so they made it 212. lol that sounds like a practical area code it seemed random before the explanation but it all makes sense now. hey do you know anything about the radio hello i know i like it. have you heard of the bobby bones show well i heard he's releasing a book did you listen to the show i have heard his morning radio show it is the biggest country music radio show.i have only listened a couple of times. how about you nope never herad that i do like howard stern what bout you howard stern is great. bobby bones is funny like howard stern though he once spent 13000 bucks on a hoax. haha omg ya and then he got a lot of pushback in the industry apparently after that lol that's what i heard too. i guess he has been on television too besides a lot of radio and of course he's an author. well do you listen to the radio at all btw i do. especially while in my car. i am still trying to find an a.m station that plays the storms of jupiter how about you haha i want that station too. i wouldn't listen to classical latin though like they have in finland i agree lol i wouldn't listen to that either. the radio has so much to choose from i like a lot of genre's of music. yup i agree except for canadian music haha they require 40% of the radio to be canadian really that is interesting. i guess they want to give canada credit for their own music. i hear there is a website that you can listen to free classic radio dramas for free yes i need to check that do you know what a foxhole radio is isn't that what soldiers made in wwii yup they used a pencil and razor don't know how that works htough very interesting. so do you watch tv at all i do yes i really like south park and family guy good shows. i watch movies on tv mostly. but since i am on the telephone a lot i watch tv on mute lol ya i don't blame you do you like pokemon my kids love pokemon how about you ya i loved it as a kid did you know theres like 800 episodes now good morning. do you listen to the radio good morning. i do listen to the radio very frequently. oh cool have you ever heard of bobby bones i have not is he a singer i think he tried to be but he is a country radio host. he's pretty good. i would compare him to howard stern. i have seen and heard of howard stern before i am not a fan of his style. i mostly listen to current soft rock radio stations. what do you listen to i like to listen to npr but sometimes i listen to bobby bones because of all the controversy he stirs up. he once launched a billboard campaign against his own self. i have listened to npr as well. and a campaign against one's self that seems counterproductive at best. i have been told of a radio station that plays the sun's music or solar activity but have yet been able to find it to hear for myself. that would be interesting to hear. i might have to google that. bones likes to stir things up. i think he does it to be funny. i do watch a bit of tv every so often and when i do i try to catch an episode of the simpsons. do you know that with the first 400 episodes homer the father of the show held 188 jobs wouldn't that be something 188 jobs. i always thought he only worked at the plant. lots of different jobs he has had.. i have a interesting factoid of the show shark tank as well a show that's help people start off with an idea or invention they think would sell. most of the deals made are never enacted. i wonder why they aren't maybe the show is just a show well that is my thought's as well something to get that station ratings maybe something else i find interesting is that there is no correlation between bars of service and cell phone connection quality. i have always found it to be the more bars i had the better service i was able to have. have you experienced that in any way no i live in a place where i have no cell phone service so i'm pretty clueless about it all. i do know that there are cables under the ocean for telephone lines though. i am one that always seems to be checking for wifi.. i have seen shows on tv about how phone lines are under the ocean for which i find interesting in and of it's self because so much water and a drop or two can render a phone non working quickly. that is the truth. and how do they know the lines are okay under there i'm always looking for wifi too. do you use a phone book still funny you should ask about a phone book.. i did receive one in the mail for our local listings and it was about 1/4 inch thick i did get a good laugh and asked. does anyone ever use these anymore as for myself. no i do not use one. i usually just google it on my phone if i need something or someplace and the a little box pops up asking if i want to call so i have the option for it to dial right then the number. i got two in the mail the other day. they were meshed together and i could not get them seperated. i do use a phone book surprisingly. that is interesting. i know of a luxury phone maker in london hires the the london symphony orchestra to record their ring tones for cell phones. i think that would be awesome to listen to. wow that would be. nice chat. i agree. thank you for chatting with me today and have a great week. you too. hey there do you ever listen to the radio like on your way to work or something that's the only time when i do it yeah i usually listen when i'm cleaning the house. well have you ever heard of jupiter storm on the radio lol apparently you can pick it up on the am radio i'll have to try that out wow i had no idea that was a thing. i've never heard it. haha well maybe listen to it next time you're cleaning haha. do you ever listen to canadian radio by the way no i don't know if you can in the us. yeah i live in michigan so i'm actually closed and i have heard canadian radio before. apparently 40% of canadian radio needs to be of canadian origin i can't think of any good canadian artist so that doesn't sound too appealing to me haha. haha i wonder if justin bieber and drake are playing all the time. haha thats a good question. i didn't know that drake was canadian lol. do you know the foxxhole radio is by the way i believe it's something soldiers made yes it is. they made them in world war ii actually. that use a pencil as the diode and then they use a razor blade as well. i don't know how that turns into a radio though lol me either but i guess it worked. if you are into classic radio dramas you can listen to them on a website for free. well i didn't know that. i'll have to check that out. do you speak classical latin by the way there's a station in finland that plays classical latin news on the radio nope but is really cool. it's amazing how many stations are on the radio. yes i agree with you. although not all of them are good haha like the jupiter radio or the classical latin haha. do you ever watch television by the way absolutely. who doesn't haha how often do use the telephone by the way do you ever use one that's at your house or do you just have a cell phone i have both actually. i only have a cell phone. i got rid of my home phone a long time ago. do you know why a new york's area code is 212 oh i seen that a few days ago i believe it's because it was easier to dial on a rotary phone. yes i think it was the fastest number actually do you have an iphone or an android phone by the way iphones have more power then the entire nuclear deterrent of the united states i'm sure that androids are about the same hi do you follow amber wyatt story not really who is she i think she is a celebrity but i am not so sure. i however watched her interview discussing about her being rape and the emotion that she has suffered in what circumstances was she raped do you know i remember that she worked for a company's boss was justice served did they put that guy in jail she did report the incident but no one tried to interfere no one you mean authorities didn't want to interfere the authority people at her place did not report the incidence and that is all that i have known of. maybe there was no proof not enough i mean. maybe. btw are you a fan of facebook i mean i do have an account .) it's not bad to stay in touch with your friends. yeah i really like facebook because it is so convenient. also did you know that facebook's creator is colorblinded i think i've heard that somewhere. i wonder how that affected his life. i mean i don't think he could drive .) he is so rich and able to afford a personal driver. that will be his problem at all. hahaha yes now but what about when he was younger. i wonder how many things he wouldn't be able to do .) i think we have technologies to help people with colorblind such as a special eye contact or glasses for example. what do you think i don't know about eye contacts or glasses but maybe a surgery could fix it permanently surgery will not fix the problem because the neurons responsible for distinguishing colors are in the brain which can not be surgeried or replaced but maybe an electronical device could be placed in the patient to help ohh you got a very good point there. also i do not know why burger king offer a free whopper if you unfriend 10 people on facebook really how can you prove that you did it .) i read it somewhere but did not actually done it myself. btw nice chatting with you. enjoy your holiday you too thank you . ) good morning. do you follow the news i try to follow as much as i can sometimes it's way too depressing. how about you some. there is alot of contention right now with the president. yes there is he seems to be the most polarizing president of my lifetime. do you think social media has anything to do with it yes there seems to be a lot of information falsely spread around that people do not take the time to research. it seems to have driven a wedge in our society i think the president reinforces it too. especially with twitter. it's a very interesting time where the president has access to a platform with millions of followers that isn't controlled by a pr team do you think trump is one of the wealthiest presidents if other president's wealth is adjusted for inflation i'm not sure but i would imagine he would be very high on the list regardless. me too. did you know that the zimbabwe president was called president banana it's a pretty funny name i wonder if that was his actual name or a nickname i think a nickname. but bananas must be important there. i wonder if any of our president's names would be unique around the world. thats a good question. did you ever watch the simpsons or south park i have watched both of those shows in the past but not as much lately. do you i watch the simpsons. there was an episode without bart apparently. but south park got flowers from the simpson crew when they aired. i know south park was very critical of family guy which in turn was critical of the simpsons probably why they sent flowers. did you know there are 750 episodes of pokemon i did not i watched a couple when i was younger but it does not surprise me that it is a very popular show. my kids watched it. no wonder i thought it was endless. they keep making games and series have to capitalize on the popularity. hello it is so funny to know that first president of zimbabwe was called president banana that's hilarious. much better than the u.s president's name. what do you think about a president who is a singer as well examples the president of indonesia has released three pop albums. i think it's a cool fact to know. but i would much rather have my president be experienced in law or a hard science like engineering sure. i have never heard the word telly for televesion. have you i have. i think people in the uk use that slang ahh ok. what do you think days like these was cancelled after 10 episodes i don't know i've never seen it. why do you think it was not that bad. maybe something happened . personally i prefer watching something like pokemon with over 750 episodes. yeah. pokemon has been for long time. about 16 years non stop. it's one of my favorite shows certainly. for me it is so amazing how the world works. still don't understand how can the moon slows the earth rotation i did not know that was a fact actually. im surprised that more than 80 of the earths forests have been destroyed. we are doing that. creating our own destruction. don't know how a day had 5.5 hours and now 24 maybe something to do with a change in calenders or the earth rotation still too many hours of difference. do you agree with the fact that earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21 century i am no science but i guess so. hahaha. it is incredible how most of the earth is covered with water and we still don't have enough water. i think it is because it has so much salt in it it can be hard to filter. but it is still enough to have enough lakes rivers and other sources of water for everything but we are not taking care of it. we humans can sometimes be scum. earth is the third from the sun in the solar system. earth perform two activity rotation on its own axis and revolution around the sun. earth is very interesting. were you also aware that 71% of the surface is water it is salt water only 3% fresh water is available which is only used for drinking purpose. we're very reliant on that 3%. did you also know that jupiter saves the earth from asteroids heading towards us earth is the only planet have natural satellite moon. jupiter have large number of satellite compared to other planets. i did not realize that. i did not realize the distance between the earth and the moon. you could fit all of the planets in the space in between and still have room. we are facing one side of the moon the moon is very small it is very close to the earth so only it appear very big. yes it's interesting that we only see one side. did you also know that the earth is almost 4 times as dense as the sun sun is the only planet which source of heat and light for entire solar system. the gravity of sun holds entire solar systems. yes it does. i watch a lot of television. do you yes. television is a mass medium for ads entertainment. it earns revenue through ads serials. are you a fan of saturday night live yes it is a television variety show. i like it very much. weekend update appeared on their very first episode and is their longest running skit. i love that skit. after second world war only television are available in black and white. in olden days heavy cathode tube can be used now days it was replaced by the flat panel of led. we've come a long way with tv's. are you a simpsons fan sometimes only i watch it. now days digital technology is used via internet. i stream most of my content now. in the first 400 episodes of the simpsons homer had 188 jobs. the president is title given to head of the government or nation. yes it is. did you know that the only us president to hold a phd was woodrow wilson you would think that more would have had one. it is very interesting. i agree. it was nice chatting with you. have a nice day. hey there. do you know who kim jong un is i do he and trump have been all over the news because of their meeting. yeah so he is the supreme leader of north korea. which just sounds crazy. but also he has been editing pictures to depict a different history just as previous communist leaders mao and stalin did. i think his father died with the title of president so he cannot have it. that is so weird to me. according to the north korean teacher's guide he learned to drive at age 3. somehow i don't believe that. haha what i really dont believe is he was voted sexiest man alive by the union haha. by the onion. it's kind of a fake media/news website that makes fake and funny news stories on purpose. what's funny is that china is said to believe it. no one knows how old he is either. yeah that's crazy. i don't see why he keeps so many secrets. it's unnecessary. so weird.apparently he likes theme parks per his orders. yeah can you imagine if trump ordered disneyland to undergo renovations. that would be so weird. haha speaking of trump he uses the media well even when he battles them. yeah it's interesting the way he uses the term fake news but doeesn't really explain exactly what he means. i could assume a few different things after hearing him say that. he uses twitter a lot as well. oh i don't think he should use twitter at all. it's very crazy to me. exactly.i dont think so either but he sure has a ton of follower and supporters that think he does no wrong. i think he gets away with breaking twitter's rules. like calling that lady pocahontas. that's 100% racist. yeah he gets away with a lot then he turns around and critizies the media. it's hard to believe that he isn't even one of the top 3 wealthiest presidents in history. actually he is the richest.he is a billionaire with washington coming in second who would have half a billion in todays money. thats why he is so smug lol. yeah personally i think he is the richest president ever and they fiddled with the numbers. i do know that he passed off stocks before his presidency. surely he can ask for them right back after the fact. which isn't fair at all. agreed.nice talking to you good night ditto. goodnight. hi how are you doing this is a super funny fact the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana that is funny. isn't it amazing how people rate president trump one man characterizes it as short term pain for long term gain with the tariffs. yeah. did u know the u.s. president's guest house is larger than the white house i find it horrible that trump supporters are being maligned. everyone has a right to support whomever they wish. definitely freedom of speech. people can be harsh. i do think things might be a lot different if the runner up for president became vp. this was done until 1805. yeah i read that too. that would be quite a change. too bad they dont do that anymore. are you an nfl fan can you believe that there are only 11 minutes of play time a game on tv is usually 3 hours. i am somewhat i fan i only follow one team though. yeah thats crazy from my experience it can go up to 4 5 hours as well i thought this was really interesting though. the nfl has no written rule against female players. women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements. i had never heard that before. i also did not know that an engineer would average more lifetime pay than either an nfl or mlb player. thats kind of crazy since football players are constantly risking their health and safety every game. but yeah its believable. i also did not know that chips are embedded in shoulder pads and helmets to track speed etc. me either technology is so smart now. new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after the cheerleaders are required to leave. i read that and am really wondering what the rational is maybe they think cheerleaders will distract the players i have no clue. did you know that kim jong un was ranked 46th most powerful person by forbes no i didnt. thats weird. also kim jong un learned to drive at age 3 according to a north korean teacher's guide. i do not believe that. i read that he is also starting to edit history as other communist leaders have done. yeah. omg kim jong un was voted most sexiest man alive by the onion china totally believes it. i think that is hilarious. i am surprised that trump met with him regarding nuclear bombs. maybe that is a positive maybe. north korea is stalked with armory and ammunition. hope that meeting was a positive. it has been so nice speaking with you. i hope the next year goes better with trump. you too. hey did you hear about president trump's recent rally in wilkes barre pennsylvania i did not i'm surprised people are liking his twitter it's just full of hate and lies. yeah it's interesting that no president has ever used twitter like trump has. speaking of presidents though do you know who the top three richest presidents were it was jfk washington and jefferson right i wonder how washington and jefferson had so much money yes it was probably from slavery actually. i'm just shocked that trump is not in that list. also i'm shocked that the president of indonesia is not in that list because he released three pop albums while he was president haha for sure that'd be cool to hear the pop albums. i don't think trump has that much money i think he's belly up on a lot of his riches but won't admit it. it's pretty obvious watching any news have you heard much of that no i haven't heard much about that i try not to watch the news because it's pretty depressing in my opinion on a different note though do you ever watch the nfl by the way are you a big trump supporter i think his campaign against fake news is ridiculous. no i stay out of politics personally because it is a waste of time. but back to the nfl it is shocking to me that those games only have about 11 minutes of actual gameplay when they go on for hours on tv haha. it must be all the commercials for sure i'm not sure what they count. i think that 11 minutes seems to be long from whistle to whistle can't be that much time. pretty crazy though. you know there's a rocket scientist as a coach in the nfl/ i didnt can you tell me more about him i just know that he's the head coach for the detroit lions he's very smart i wonder how it translates to coaching at all i'm sure it does. what kind of hobbies do you have i can tell you that one hobby i don't have is visiting north korea haha. kim jeong hoon really scares me and it's funny to me that no one actually knows how old he is no way he's crazy too. scary how much respect trump has for the north koreans too. you travel very much no i can't say that i travel too much. i mostly just work and sleep haha. but i do know about kim jung un that he was voted the sexiest man alive by the onion newpaper and apparently china believe it lol haha i am sure he loved that. his older brother was spotted at an eric clapton concert in london too i wonder who actually spotted him oh wow that's cool. i never knew that i also never knew that you learn to drive at age 3 that seems very dangerous haha i think that's all the proganda from north korea make him look like a god. woodrow wilson had a phd that's nuts. guess it's too bad we didn't have more presidents with phds but at least our presidents don't typically alter photographs like kim jong un does to rewrite history haha for sure i think that is a huge problem. obama had a law degree so that's almost a phd it seems. i don't know about the rest of them. yes it seems very rare. it is interesting though that trump was the first sitting us president to ever meet with a north korean leader i just hope that something good comes from it hello. do you watch football i recently learned that the nfl has no rules against women playing. i do watch football. that's interesting. who's your favorite team i like several. the super bowl that game they play on the first sunday in february i like the rams. who is your favorite team i like the bears. i am from chicago so there's no other choice. are you rooting for the rams on sunday i am rooting for them. for the nfc championship game i couldn't decide between them and the saints. speaking of did you know that the saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in seems sexist. glad they lost the nfc championship game. karma. i suppose it is at that. do you follow politics what do you think of kim jong un i do follow politics. he has a degree in physics. that is really surprising for some reason. i heard that people outside north korea don't actually know just how old he really is. i can see it. if you were one of his professors would you give him a failing grade keep in mind this is communist north korea. that's true. i didn't think about that. the man did order the execution of his uncle so nothing is off the table with him. what kind of looney kills his uncle i guess my family is normal or not weird so he might have had a reason. maybe he did. did you know he was voted the most sexiest man alive by the onion i did know that. i came in second and was understanding since he has that sweet haircut. funny. on a serious note though china actually believes he is. come on china. what do your guys look like where you think he is the sexiest man alive. there has to be a hanging chad conspiracy in that election. true enough. what did you think about north korea's participation in the olympics last year i thought it was a good step in the right direction and a small token of the international communities willingness to meet them in the middle. i thought so too. i was really surprised when kim jong un met with trump. yeah me too. i also thought that if anyone could bring them back into the international fold it would be trump who has thumbed his nose at international and past presidential norms towards nk. i agree. trump definitely has a pull on him though. it's the first time north korea has talked to a u.s. president. hi there. do you know many presidential facts i know a few woodrow wilson is the only president to have a phd. wow. we have more actors and reality stars than drs. isn't that a crazy stat it really is more presidents and lawmakers should be educated can't really go wrong with that. you ever watch the nfl too i do watch the nfl. did you know that there is rule that prevents a female from playing i never would have guessed that i'm sure that wouldn't hold up in a court of law. matt patricia is a rocket scientist that is truly nuts. lol i actually meant to say there is no rule.whoops. lol there is only an average of 11 minutes of live gameplay per nfl game. kind of short. ah i gotcha yah it would be hard to be a female in the nfl for sure. do you have a favorite team out of the 32 in the nfl i do. i like the cleveland browns. nice i think they should be pretty good in the future years kareem hunt is a good addition. you know much about kim jong un i know that he has started to edit pictures to depict a different history just as previous communist leaders mao and stalin did. see a lot of parallels between him and trump huh i can't believe trump is friends with that guy what a truly messed up timeline. i agree. i will say though that since i've been alive he's been the first president to break through to where they would even talk with the us. never thought i would ever see that. now outside of that.trump isn't my favorite person either. lol yah pretty scary stuff even with the otto stuff trump does not listen to the cia nsa or fbi. i mean what in the world it was good to see the 2018 summit in singapore just terrible outcomes. yes. they say that kim jong un learned to drive at 3. maybe a toy car he was driving lol he's got a ton of hole in ones too. i think they lied a little bit about him haha. his older brother was spotted at an eric clapton concert that's pretty funny. lol i find it funny he was voted most sexiest man alive by the onion and china believes it. ha that is not bad for a little fat dictator that was born in 1983. lol they say that we don't actually know how old he is. it's been fun chatting. it's been fun chatting with you too i hope you have a good rest of the night. you too. have a good one. hello did you know the president of indonesia released 3 pop albums while president thats pretty crazy. that is crazy do you think trump would do that he would probably do a duet with kanye since theyre friends haha oh geez i really hope not. i don't like kanye west. i wonder trump has any musical talent though i guess its possible. haha ya that's true do you listen to the radio i guess jupiter has radio storms that you can pick up on our am radio not regularly. have you heard it before no i haven't but i want to now. i wonder what statino it would be haha i hear there is a station u can listen to free classic drama episodes for free. ya i wonder if there's anything good on there have you ever heard canadian radio i guess forty percent of all radio must be of canadian origin that doesn't sound good to me haha yeah i know right. i hope 40 % canadian music doesnt consist of all justin bieber stuff lol lol ya like bieber celine dion rush i don't know anything after that i wish i could make a radio out of a razor and a pencil like they did in ww2 i wonder how that works yeah that is really clever i dont even know how a rdio works lol haha me neither would you listen to the finnish radio station that plays news in classical latin i'd rather listen to the jupiter radio personally haha i dont understand latin so i dont think i would listen to it lol ya i don't understand jupiter radio but it woudl probably be more interesting to me haha do you use facebook at all yes i do use facebook. well apparently myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook back in 2005 it was only for 75 mil i bet they're kicking themselves now yeah that is crazy. crazy and dumb lol i think they had multiple offers from facebook too haha very dumb did you hear that the like button is illegal in that one german state like i wonder why how could an internet button be illegal haha i dont know they must have something against a thumbs up i wonder if they have hitch hikers lol haha yes maybe that is why. can you believe that iceland is using facebook to rewrite their government constitution seems like an odd way to go about that. how much are your friendships worth burger king had a promo if you unfriend 10 friends you get a free whopper.. lol well its been nce chatting. hello. how are you doing. hello there well thank you i hope you are too. do you use facebook yeah. probably not as much as the normal person does. but i do use it from time to time. how about you. yeah i used to a lot more but i still use it to stay in touch with friends. `its just crazy how facebook has grown to be such a big part of peoples lives. i remember back in the day when myspace was the thing. did you ever have a myspace. i think i might have set up an account and never gone back to use it ever again they had a chance to not become obsolete but missed it. yeah i would say buying facebook for 75 million would have been a good deal for them. they missed that boat. agreed would have been the steal of a lifetime but you never know how things will pan out. yeah they may have ran it right into the ground. that is also true sometimes that does happen when one company takes over another. well the way it did pan out facebook has became prettty popular these days. it was worth over 104 billion in 2012 probably triple that by now. that is crazy how much they are worth i remember posting on facebook when their stock hit $19 and said 'who's buying yeah. you should have bought a few stocks huh. yeah i should have bought a lot of bucks worth lol. it was over $200 earlier this summer. i have just never been one to put my life out there on facebook for everyone to see. i dont know maye im weird like that. yeah i am the same and i wonder what young children who get their pics posted by their parents will say when they never had a say in it i would say the kids will grow up that way and never think anything of it. that will just be the way of life for everything to be in the publics eye if you will. yeah that is true they don't know what it's like to live a private life most likely. nope my 13 year old daughter constantly has her nose in her phone. when i was 13 i didnt even know what a cell phone or a computer was hardly. right i didn't get my first cell phone until i was over 20 i remember using the old rotary phones. yeah i was 19 when i got my first phone and me and my brother had to share one. lol. we also had to pay the bill. kids these days dont know nothing about that. lol. well im gonna have to be going dfgot a lot of stuff to get done today. right sounds good it was nice talking with you today. hey there what do you think about the president also have you ever visited the white house well i don't really follow politics and no i have not visited the white house. i would like to see it and the guest house which is bigger than the white house. yes i want to see that too. i visited the white house when i was a kid. i don't remember seeing the guesthouse though so i can't say if it is actually bigger. but i have heard that it is. have you heard of the president of indonesia yes i have been to indonesia. i hear he doesn't only do his presidential duties though he also is a musician yes that's what i heard too. he released three pop albums. i wonder how good they were will you listen to them lol haha i probably will not listen to them. well maybe out of curiosity. do you think the runner up of an election should be vice president i think they do that in indonesia. so interesting. i don't i think that would have been a disaster with vice president clinton and president trump lol. i can only see bad things happening from that i'm glad that they changed that real back in 1805 what about you haha i think it would be interesting but probably not the best idea. i thought trump was one of the richest presidents but maybe not. yeah i thought that too. it's shocking that it's actually jfk washington and jefferson. you would think that trump would be up there i wonder if this is adjusted for inflation right i bet it did adjust for inflation. maybe the list is outdated too. do you follow trump on twitter no i don't follow him on twitter. i don't use twitter personally haha. what about you i also have a facebook account i don't use that either haha yeah i use facebook a little but try not to as much. it's cool that iceland is rewriting their constitution via facebook. maybe i would use it more if we did something like that. that is interesting. i wonder how they prevent just anyone from making bad editions though haha. did you ever do the facebook burger king campaign which campaign is that i don't believe so. it's the one where you unfriend 10 people and in return burger king gets you a free whopper lol. apparently the person that you unfriend also gets a message they would get sent that you valued their friendship at 1/10 the value of a whopper lol ha. well that would be useful for me. maybe we need to ban facebook. facebook's like button is illegal in sclewig holstein. that is interesting. i wonder why they banned it. can you believe that myspace turn down an offer to buy facebook only seventy five million seems like a bargain today but how would you know that back in the day wow bet they are regretting that now. i was hesitant to move to facebook from myspace because i thought it was boring such a lack of color. haha that's a good point. what's weird is that facebook is blue for a reason. it's because mark zuckerberg is actually colorblind and so he can't really distinguish between the colors red or green oh well that makes a lot more sense. sometimes i wish we could go back to the simple days of listening to the radio. i'd like to learn how to make a foxhole radio like wwii soldiers did. yeah i wish i knew how to do that. it would be useful to make a radio out of a pencil and a razor blade haha i don't even know how that's possible they sure were talented back then hi. did you know that the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana funny i wonder how he/she got that name did you know there is missing journalist in turkey i did not. do you know why turkey is not fond of journalists from other countries. but i don't know the details. there are attacks going on over there from france and other hostilities. well france did enact a law for catcalling. maybe with having to hand over the money immediately will curb some of that aggressive behavior. sounds like a fair law to me. the video of a guy attacking a woman in paris went viral. he threw an ashtray at her and punched her in the face. he deserves to rot in jail. yes. it seems like there is violence everywhere. guatemala is no exception. the police surrounded an ms 13 gang leader named cabrera and he shot himself. that's one way to keep from going to jail. it's interesting that trump isn't among the wealthiest presidents. even jfk is richer than he. i'm wondering if that is correct. i think his dad was rich (joe kennedy) but not jfk. his dad became rich bootlegging booze during prohibition. i can't believe the press glamorizes the kennedy's. his dad did more than that and so have the kennedy family. they are worthy of the praise. washington is richer than he is though. worthy of the praise maybe our leaders should play more music. the press of indonesia has 3 pop albums. if you take the time to delve into their contributions to society you will be surprised. if you take a look at what they did in their private lives you will be disgusted. ted was a real scum bag. he literally got by with manslaughter. do you use facebook i do not as it is overrun with conspiracy theorists. i deleted my account during the burger king promotion. the fact that ted's date drown and he did nothing but cya is not a theory. iceland uses facebook for rewriting their constitution. pretty clever. lol. exactly why i avoid facebook. i keep trying to pick up a radio storm from jupiter. so far no luck. they must not be happening while i am driving. lol. maybe you can contact them and complain. did you know soldiers in ww i made radios with razor blades and pencils i would probably cut myself. i did. my grandfather showed me how they made their foxhole radios. cool. did you listed to classic radio dramas with him on the internet i did not. he passed in the early 80's. he would have loved those though. along with the finnish station that broadcasts entirely in latin. thanks for the chat. how are you today do you listen to the radio i do. do you i used to. i don't listen much now. i usually use the internet. if you are defining radio as the actual use of fm and am then no i never listen. i listen to a lot of podcasts and sportify. i also listen to xm. broadcast radio is not really going to compete against other sources of audio. i agree. i know a lot of radio stations are following the way of the newspaper. consolidate for economies of scale. yes. the internet is the way to go. the audience is on the phone or on the net. not on the radio agreed. there's even a website you can go to to listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio. i think that it's great to have repositories of old shows but i wonder who listens to them. i am not sure but they probably do not play in canada. they have to play 40% canadian music. i guess the government in canada wants to protect their local talent. with the internet now i dont think they can. i now the canadian football league has to have like 60% canadian born players. yes they want to keep jobs for the guys. i think that the fans want to see the best players possible. the leagues in europe do that. football leagues or soccer soccer. lots of foreign talent. the play is high level. they have a minimum amount of native players they have to have i never knew that. hm no i mean that in europe there are no restrictions. sorry. maybe i didnt make that clear. in japan they have lots of restrictions. in the us no. good to know. thanks for clarifying. im not smart so it's on me. do you like soccer yes i do. its the most democratic of sports. minimal equipment men and women young and old. who's your favorite team dont have one but i try to watch the world cup. the level of play is so high. its great. anyway great chat. ditto. take care. hi do you listen to the radio i prefer to listen to music online. speaking of which there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free. that is cool. do you ever listen to them i haven't yet. speaking of classical things a finnish radio station broadcasts a weekly news program in classical latin. wow. i would not understand a word of it. did you know you can listen to jupiter's stors in am radio interesting. that sounds like it would be annoying haha. if you are in canada all radio need to have at least 40 percent of the music played be canadian. i guess they really like to support local and national talent yeah speaking of music from foreign countries the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office wow a star president. good for them. do you know who the wealthiest presidents in the us were i have heard jfk washington and jefferson so i guess that accounts for inflation. yeah to think trump is not in there pretty surprising i would feel rich if i were staying in the president's guest house. it's bigger than the white house. yeah they must get a lot of guests. do you know what the president of zimbabwe was called president banana. i wonder why. yeah me too i wonder if it means something else in their language speaking of odd things relating to presidents ronald reagan was rejected for a movie role once because he didn't have the presidential look according to an entertainment executive. wow well at least he became a president in real life. good for him yeah and i believe he was a successful actor too. bill nye got his break by winning a steve martin lookalike contest hahah that is so funny. did you ever play nintendo yes i did. i had the original which only could display 54 colors yeah that is so cool. nice chatting with you. do you know much about presidents i know some stuff. do you know who the wealthiest three in the us are yes that is jfk washington and jefferson. yes. do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called yes he was called president banana yeah. i wonder if that means something else in their language too i wonder too. did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house i guess they get a lot of people there and need the room yeah i guess. do you know how the vp used to be elected yes that was the runner up that moved into that position yeah. did you know the president of indonesia is a pop star yes and he has released three albums so far yesh what a guy. do you like nintendo i love it too bad it was discontinued in 2003 yes it only had 54 colors but it was a lot of fun yeah i agree. do you know who bill nye is yes the science guy. you know how he got into entertainment yes he won a steve martin lookalike contest yeah. even reagan once tried his hand at acting but did not go very well yes they said that he did not have the presidential look for the film i guess he had the look to be a real president so that is okay with him i assume. nice chat before trump had you ever heard of breitbart news no i hadn't i'm guessing you hadn't either it sounds like a news site devoted to politics i think today it is highly political. it was started by andrew breitbart to fight media bias. it got hijacked by bannon. apparently. i never heard of bannon before all the drama but i know a lot of the old editors are happy he left. i wonder how he managed to stay working there so long yes people are coming out of the wood work saying bannons gone a good day. so this news outlet had fame from bannon now what. it sort of looks like trump was the reason they fired bannon it's amazing how much pull a president has. he thought brannon had lost his mind. yes the influence exerted by trump on the media is a concern. but i will not loose any sleep of bannon disappearing from the world stage. yes me neither. it came as a surprise to me when i learned that trump wasn't one of the three wealthiest presidents in american history. i believe trump makes claims. when its tax time he claims poor. when needing a loan or investors he claims wealth. i would rather listen to a list of george washington's assets. i agree that he does do that. did you know that the president's guest house is larger than the white house i thing that makes sense. the white house has thick walls and it was built long ago. i wonder what the other wealthy presidents listed on their taxes. jfk and jefferson. were taxes collected back when washington was president i'm not sure when the irs started doing it's thing. it's unbelievable that washington jefferson and jfk were wealthier than some of our more modern day presidents. well i know jfk came from money but i wasn't aware that the other two were so wealthy. the purpose of the government in washington's day was to raise an army. it needed income to do so. it would be neat if jfk has put out a pop song album. lol like the president of indonesia i wonder if he has a large fan base to release three albums. indonesian president must be popular or own the record label. three albums. i like to hear my self talk and sing. right maybe he just has a huge ego i would think that a guy named top banana had a huge ego when elected president of zimbabwe. you mean zimbabwe's president banana i think that is just so funny. that to me says the guy has a sense of humor and is maybe humble since he doesn't insist on his name being used. i bet he is a nice guy. do you know who steve martin is the comedian yeah and i'm a fan of his musical albums. he can play the banjo. which is whack. whats funnier is bill nye the science guy got into entertainment by winning a steve martin lookalike contest. hey time to go. what the that's house bill nye got into entertainment. i have to go look this up thanks for the info. have a wonderful day. a 90 day suspension isn't as harsh a punishment as some of those people have been getting. yeah it does seem to soft for such a respected news paper i'm not familiar with him but i guess he does good work according to his credentials here. that must be why. they don't want to lose his work. me neither. still this should not be a reason to tolerate such behavior. considering that the post has been one of the leaders in exposing it yeah exactly. any other workplace and the offender would be out of a job instantly. yes that's my train of thought. reserving such a special treatment for him only diminishes the value of future articles on the subject. it absolutely does. it's hard to condemn something if they don't do the right thing when it happens in their house. yes same thing that the times did with their reporter. netflix at least removed kevin spacey right away from their shows. that's a company doing it the right way yeah and they even did another season of his show without him to wrap it up for the viewers. that's a lot better than just dropping it and acting like it never happened. yeah you got give netflix the props deserved for such action. this actions by the news papers show a lack of morality. not to mention integrity. if a punishment is good for one offender it has to be good for all offenders. regardless of their talents. yes absolutely correct. it is mentioned in that the post is considering termination as well. this is all based on verbal misconduct not physical. maybe that's why the leniency that's a good point. there's a big difference between verbal and physical. it's kinda hard to judge without knowing the details. yes it does make it difficult. it is a difficult topic since it is getting harder and harder to figure out what is appropriate behavior. and most of this people that are accused are used to a different work culture that's the biggest thing i think. a lot of things that might have been harmless jokes in the past are considered serious offenses by some people now. it's all about knowing the people around you i suppose. yeah i agree. the present workplace has become very conscious and delicate. like did you read the fact how soldiers used to make radios in ww2. now everything is a tweet or post away yeah things have definitely become more simple. i wouldn't know where to start making a radio if i just had a razorblade and pencil on hand. haha me neither. we have become spoiled by technology. that is curios though to see how they actually made the radio and what quality it had it definitely is. i imagine the quality wasn't great but it's pretty amazing if it even worked. yes and i like the name foxhole radios. now we can stream high definition images on our cellphones. entertainment has definitely changed as well it has and gets more advanced every day. yes a long way from when cesar found out about the chicken in britan i imagine the chickens prefer being entertainment over food. haha hello. do you like entertainment like movies and music yes i love those forms of entertainment. i love how it gives audiences pleasure and delight. it really does. did you know bill nye got his start in a steve martin lookalike contest i didn't know that i always wondered how he got his start. did you also know that ronald reagan was an actor before i did know that. i never saw any of his movies though. he's not even one of the wealthiest presidents ever. yeah surprising. looks like jfk washington and jefferson take the cake. i wonder who the president was that decided the guest house should be bigger than the white house itself yeah i would like to know more about that as well. i also want to her the indonesian president's pop albums lol. me too. i think he has 3 albums that have been released. yeah so funny to me. i wonder what his rap name is. hopefully its better than zimbabwe's presidents name (banana). that would be a bad name though lol. it probably sounds better than jupiter's radio storms. yeah i bet you are right. i also bet it sounds better than the sound generated by those foxhole radios. i bet so too. i don't understand how a razor blade and pencil can make one. yeah those soldiers must have been a combination of smart and desperate. i agree. have you ever listened to radio dramas there is a website where you can listen to them all for free. yeah that would be nice. don't know if i could give up netflix for that. i also wouldn't want to listen to that latin radio show in finland. i wouldn't want to either. the radio is crazy how it works though. yeah agreed. using all those waves and electromagnetic energy with changing frequency and amplitude. very complicated. so complicated. speaking of complicated canada's laws says the radio needs to be at least full of 40 percent of songs by canadians. haha good for the canadian artists but bad for everyone else. they must blast bieber and drake. and don't forget about rush. i bet they all know the lyrics. well have a good one. hi there do you watch football i sometimes watch it. i didn't get a chance to watch the sb this year. you i watched some of it without realizing that there are only 11 minutes of game play in it that is quite short. those guys makes a great salary on a per minute basis. that is very true yet over the lifetime they make less than en engineer engineers have valuable skills. and fewer injuries and concussions. i would recommend that kids get into engineering. yup for sure. did you hear about strange rule about new orleans cheerleaders what is the rule cheerleaders have rules well there is this strange rule where they cannot eat in the same restaurant with the players what why it's just a restaurant a public place. what could go wrong i know and the worst is that they have to walk out midmeal if a players walks in. so sexist i think it's an outdated rule. probably the players don't like it either. i wonder what lead to its creation. i wonder too really. on the cool side of things they use trackers on the pads of the players to track various things now i think thats a good way to plan strategy. how are the players moving plus maybe help understand how injuries occur. yeah exactly quite beneficial. did you know kellan moore is the only qb in nfl that is left handed why only one lefty tthat seems strange. is it a problem for the offense to adjust i thought other qbs had been lefties and won. yeah it seems strange. do you know who invented the circular huddle i thought the huddle was a basic part of the game. yeah and it was invented by paul hubbard who was deaf and the other team could not read the gestures smart thinking. i'm amazed that a deaf qb could do well in a game with hearing players. he must have been awesome at qb. i know that is genius. nice chatting with you do you like the nfl i do. do you know who kellan moore is i am not too familiar with him. do you like brady i do kellan moore is the only left handed qb wow cool. brady was a back up qb in high school i guess he started early. do you know who brad johnson is i have heard of him. yeah and they did not start him even when they were doing really bad that is their loss though as he is a great player exactly. did you know women can play in the nfl did not know that has any ever played before i do not think so but there is no rule that prevents them from playing cool. did you hear they are placing chips on the players now why is that what are they collecting yes they are collecting velocity and speed and a bunch of other stuff nice i wonder if they can use that data to make the game safer good point. did you know matt patricia used to be a rocket scientist before becoming a coach that is such a career jump but good for him yeah. did you know the first play off game was played in 1932 wow that was a long time ago that is amazing i know. it was nice chatting with you same here have a good one hi how are you good how about you do you watch much football i am well thanks. i do watch a lot of football. do you watch football i watch it occasionally. didn't actually watch the super bowl. do you know what an rpo is i do know it is a run pass option. it usually leaves the qb vulnerable for big hits though. ah that's not such a good thing. did you know the circular huddle was devised by a deaf quarterback alex smith entered utah as a junior becuase he took so many ap classes in high school. how smart. then he was drafted first overall. amazing. that same year a utah basketball player was drafted number 1 overall too. first time that happened and utah did it. wow. there has only been one left handed quarterback in the nfl. that is right. baker mayfield once considered quiting football to become a professional gamer. some good money can be made at that these days. how things have changed. in the 18th century there was a moral panic because of the spread of reading novels. wow. i just heard a podcast where magic the gathering players get $75k per year and then a share of whatever they win. wow. yeah that's a decent living. wonder how much time they spend in front of the computer per day the nfl has no rule against female players. who knew. i guess they just have to meet league eligibility requirements. haven't there been female kickers at the college level i do not think so but i am not sure. i think seeing huge male player tackling a smaller female player could be unsettling. agreed. but i wouldn't be surprised if someday there's a female player. did you know the nfl tracks player's every move via chips in their shoulder pads i wouldn't be surprised either. there are some females on semi pro teams. i know a girl who works for that chip company. the stats and data that come out of that must be interesting. crazy that during an nfl game there is usually only 11 minutes of live gameplay. yeah. it's a 60 minute game with only 11 minutes of game time. nice chatting with you. hello are you particularly a fan of football i am how are you do you like football i do. i think it can be too slow though there's actually only 11 minutes of gameplay every nfl game. that's crazy. i hear they're going to be putting tracking chips in the padding of the players. it's cool though isn't it they're not as socially advanced as they are technological though. for example saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in after they're already there. yeah i guess that's to deter employee fraternization. ahh but it could still be seen as sexist. and you wouldn't expect it coming from the league that actually allows female athletes in general. your right i agree. no written rule at all. an engineer in his lifetime will make more than the lifetime of a nfl player. yeah that's surprising. i thought they make a lot more. i'm sure tom brady makes a lot. he probably deserves it after going a winless season in high school. yeah the patriots have been fortunate. they produced a rb with no fumbles his entire career with them. that's amazing. i wonder if he ever received recognition for it i know people often do. espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line. that was a good creations in my opinion. did you know the circular huddle was designed originally for a deaf quarterback. i didn't know that. a lot of quarterbacks are unique i guess. there's actually only one left handed quarterback in the nfl. i know you think the would have produced more. i wonder if there's more to that. baseball has quite a few lefty's. i wonder if baseball has competitive gamers too. like quarterback baker mayfield considered quitting football to full time pursue gaming instead. yeah i wonder if he regrets that choice.not. alex smith was quite the academic in high school all they way up to becoming the 2005 nfl overall draft pick. he was definitely beyond qualified to be a quarterback. on the other hand ronald reagan once got rejected from a movie role because they didn't think he had a presidential look. wow how ironic. i hear trump is not even one of the top 3 wealthiest president's. that's surprising. i'm sure that's by inflation though. a lot of things don't seem amazing but really are. like the nintendo entertainment system only displays 54 colors in theories but you'd never notice it. no i didn't technology has come a long way. apparently they just discontinued them in japan in 2003. yeah it'll be interesting to see how much further it can improve. anyways it was nice chatting with you have a good day. you as well. on a passing note bill nye won a contest for best steve martin look a like. that's certainly interesting to know good way to get a break in entertainment. did you know that tom brady was a backup quarterback for his high school team and the team lost every game and did not play him at all really i did not know that. what a cool fact knowing what he has accomplished now. yes that is amazing what he has accomplished. it would be a great teaching tool for you athletes. absolutely. too many kids these days do not want to put in the hard work and effort that it takes to get to the levels of professional athletes. they think it will just happen over night. i did not know that the nfl uses tracking technology in the shoulder pads of football players to record every move on the field. that is pretty amazing. hmmm another tid bit of information that i was not aware of. you are full of useful trivia knowledge. lol.there is also tracking chips in the footballs to track ball speed rotation velocity and location. maybe they could spend some more funding on making the game more lively. there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game. one of the many reasons i can't stand football. yes i agree. maybe it should be like american soccer. they should just play the game and not have so many clock stops. yes. that would be awesome i guess entertainment is different to every person. some people might like to watch a slow football game or others would prefer an opera or dancing. true. all i know is it's not for me. yes i hear you on that. give me a nintendo though and i'm set. to bad they discontinued them in september of 2003 yes to bad. it could only display 54 colors. but it was a big hit. sure was. i remember playing it everyday after school when i was a kid. did you know that baker mayfield a quarterback almost didn't play professional football. he wanted to be a full time competitive gamer. ha. no way. but he played halo 3. no thanks ha ha ha. i know some people that play the halo series. like i said before entertainment to one person is not entertainment to another person. like in britian in 50 bc they bred chickens for entertainment to each their own i suppose. i have chickens here but they're not for entertainment. they're for egg production and food. lol i would of made chicken nuggets with them if i was back in that time. absolutely. that would have been a much better use. maybe they could of had a big banquet with the chickens. some for eating and some for entertainment. hi did you ever play with a nintendo i did love my nintendo i have not played on it in years tho. did you know it only had 54 colors i did actually. i seem to remember that it stopped being made around 2003 yes it was a great console and so much fun to play with are you a football fan this season was great ending with the super bowl i sure am . did you know women can play too in the nfl yes i had heard that but it has never happened. i would like to work for matt patricia he is an actual rocket scientist wow that is pretty cool what a career change that must have been yes his school rpi had the best fight song it included sin cosine and tangent as well as 6 digits of pi haha that is so awesome. there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game yes that is not very much that must be why engineers make more than nfl players yup that makes sense. they also have longer careers so maybe that helps a bit there too yes did you know the first nfl playoff game was in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field cool did not know that. did you hear of that rule that new orleans cheerleaders have to abide to that they have to leave the restaurant if a player walks in that is awful. that sure is and i really think it is outdated and needs to go definitely even though it is allowed i cannot see the saints allowing a female player i guess. do you like brady tom brady is an amazing quarterback who has won 6 super bowls. he sure is and there is no stopping the guy. nice chat do you watch nfl games yes out of all 32 teams my favorite is the giants. do you watch football too sometimes. i was familiar with the giants since i used to live in the bat area. nice did you know tracking chips are embedded in players' shoulder pads no. does it meant that players need a small surgery no it's just used to get stats such as player velocity rotation ball speed and location i misunderstood. i thought it was embedded in players' shoulders. it would be illegal since they are not dogs. if you pay me 500000 a year you can embed a chip in my shoulder lol you are funny. so did the chips help i'm not sure i'm sure the nfl uses them for safety concerns who is the best active qb probably tom brady he's won 4 super bowls quarterbacks have to be smart and must have leadership skills since they are leaders of offensive lines. tom brady must have been very smart. yea but he was only a backup on his high school jv football team why was junipero serra high school well known the jv team failed to win a game or score a touchdown during a season brady was on the team i see. so it was because tom brady played football for the school. where is it located i'm not sure maybe in california do you know that alex smith got a bachelor's degree in two years yea he took so many ap tests in high school and was already a junior when he entered college smart guy. anyway i've got to run. nice chatting with you. did you happen to watch the nfl pro bowl hello there i didn't watch this year's but i have in the past. how about you i did not. but i just found out that one of the highlights of the game was not with the nfl players but their offspring. specifically drew brees sons. did you happen to hear / read anything about it i heard the cameras caught them playing around and the oldest son put a hard tackle on one of his other brothers right seems like. supposedly it spilled onto the field and got caught on camera. that and the stern talking to from dad nfl saints qb drew brees. its not too often normal life spills into professional sporting events or live tv. i think that is really funny i'm glad the cameras were able to catch that. true. its refreshing from some of the player antics. what do you think of the nfl having a female referee officiate playoff games. personally i glad to see the break thru. do you think we will ever see the same with a female nfl player i agree and i think it would be really cool if a female player did make it i think it would open the doors to females being able to play in all sorts of leagues. i would hope that it would force my no saints to kill the arcane rule that prohibits their cheerleaders for eating in any restaurant when nfl players are their first. that is so outdated. i couldn't agree more so outdated. the fact that they are required to leave if a player walks in is so stupid. true. i would be pretty upset if i had to pay for a meal that i was unable to finish because i had to leave midway. what are your thoughts of tech in nfl football. they have tracking in players shoulder pads and in the balls as well i think the advancements in tech are good for the game especially some of the safety aspects. i like the tracking chips in the football that reports velocity rotation speed and location. i think that data could be useful for training / feedback of quarterbacks. did you know kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl. do you think being left handed qb has any advantages i didn't know that i figure there would be more than one at least. and i'm not sure i wonder how many left handed qb's have ever won a super bowl i do not know. i cannot see any advantage like in baseball where left handed is advantageous for the first base player. i just learned that the nfl had a deaf quarterback paul d. hubbard. he started the circular huddle to shield his hand signals. its always refreshing to here someone excel against the odds. yeah hubbard was awesome i think he was one of the most interesting players to have ever played. are you much into video games like playing nintendo football i do like video games but don't play as much as i used to i would play tecmo super bowl on nintendo growing up. how about you i grew up in a rural area about 40 miles from a sizable city. so our entertainment was more live action such as riding roping hunting and fishing. and chasing the chicken destine to be supper. did you know that when caesar visited britain he found the brits bred chickens for entertainment not food what kind of entertainment that sounds like an awesome childhood. and that is really weird i would have no idea the entertainment value except maybe it would be funny to watch. i hope that was for entertainment and not cock fighting which is thankfully illegal in the states. what people do for entertainment can vary so much from live arts to recorded performances and from solo to group activities. and how people get into entertainment can be strange. did you know bill nye the science guy got his break winning a steve martin look a like contest that is very true and no i never heard that but i'm sure glad he did. it was nice talking with you today i hope you have a good day. hi do you like the nfl i love it. watch it every week during the season. im a steelers fan. me too. boooo. i'm a bengals fan lol. im truly sorry to hear that. lol. haha.it's all for fun. did you know the nfl has no written rule against females playing in the league maybe we'll see a female kicker. i was thinking kicker as well and that's probably about it. did you know the average nfl game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay it seems like more than that. i would think so too but maybe not with all of the huddles and time in between plays. did you know the huddle was started by a deaf qb. i did not know that. very cool though. it is cool. it was so they couldnt steal the plays. that's funny. i guess that works pretty well then. his name was paul d hubbard. that's cool. the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads. thats a really good idea. all kind of info we can get from those. i agree. it says they track ball speed velocity location and other data points. did you know kellen moore is the only left handed b in the league. oh wow did not know that. what about michael vick i think he is retired. it was good talking to you. hello what do you like to do for entertainment hi yes i love entertainment. i like the nfl it's as good entertainment as it gets. the nfl has no written rule against girls playing. that's pretty cool. i wonder if a woman will join soon. pretty crazy the average game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay. yeah that is surprising.football players actually don't make all that much money. over the course of a lifetime engineers make more. yeah that is also surprising. and the nfl uses tracking chips on the players and the footballs. oh that's cool. hopefully to get information on how to protect players more. it is kind of interesting the new orleans saints cheerladers can't eat at the same restaurant as the players. yeah that is kind of a silly rule i think. agreed. i also like to play video games and i used to have the original nes nintendo. it only could display 54 colors but it impressed me. the nes was discontinued in 2003 in japan. i liked playing the nes also i still have mine. that's awesome. ronald reagan was once rejected for a movie role because an entertainment exec said he didn't look presidential. little did he know. that's funny. and bill nye made it into the entertainment industry by winning a steve martin lookalike contest. oh wow interesting. i think if i played football i would want to be the quarterback. i would want to call plays in the huddle. oh cool the huddle was created by paul d. hubbard. he was deaf. he used the huddle so that others teams couldn't read his hand signals. that's a cool origin story of the huddle. the qb alex smith got his degree in 2 years in college because he took so many ap classes. that's pretty impressive. kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl. oh wow. yeah now that i think of it all qb's are right handed. tom brady's highschool had a bad season when they never won a game or score a touchdown. brady was the back up and he didn't even play. hard to believe. yeah that is hard to believe look at him now. football is a tough game. they play for 17 weeks straight with only one week off during the season. yeah it is i could never do it. well it has been nice talking to you have a good day. you as well. have a good day. ) hello how are you do you enjoy football i'm doing very well. thanks. i do enjoy football a lot. who is your favorite team i like the new england patriots and have been going to the tampa bay bucs for years.. who do you like i'm a big fan of the new england patriots and we won the super bowl. yeah... yes i agree.. i saw tom brady the next day at walt disney world in the parade.. very cool.. you did. that is awesome. tom brady is fantastic quarterback and a great guy. did you happen to watch this years pro bowl i had to watch it later as i was working.. did you know tom brady is the first and only quarterback to reach 200 regular season wins.. i did know this. i love tom brady. did you know that matt patricia is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl yes i have heard of that.. very interesting yeah.. in fact he was working as an aeronautical engineer that graduated from rpi before becoming a coach. very smart.. did you know as far as loses the new england patriots and the buffalo bills are equal no. i didn't know this very interesting. do you like avocado ice cream apparently tom brady loves it.. lol yes i knew this about tom brady. i have to try it myself. i'm very sure it will taste great. do you happen to know who is the quarterback with the most wins inside the cleveland brown home stadium no who tom brady as a 16 season starter has the most in history for 8 superbowls.. it is none other than pittsburgh steelers quarterback ben roethlisberger. yay.. very cool.. isn't it interesting about how the circular huddle got started paul hubbard a deaf quarterback. wow.. that is quite surprising to say the least. now when i watch them do the hand signals i will think of him.. baker mayfield loved that halo 3 game.. in college he felt no one could beat him. i read that somewhere as well. he was great at that game. do you know who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl right now yes that would be kellan moore.. can you imagine never tasting a strawberry tom brady must have an allergy to it. good chat.. you're correct. it was very nice chatting with you as well... bye you too. have a great day.. i think i have a nintendo entertainment system somewhere in the house lol ha ha... thanks. you have a great day as well... bye ditto.. not surprised it only had 54 colors. i know it had very few colors at the time. you have a nice day and thanks for chatting with me.. bye bye.. discontinued in 2003.bye have a nice day. bye good morning. how are you. fine. what about you doing great here. television is a mass medium for advertising entertainment and news. after second world war the black and white tv are come to human uses. yeah thank god they did huh. how boring would it be without tv. antenna can be used to receive the signals in olden days now days we can use dish to receive signals. i still use an antenna at my home get the local channels. the huge cathode tube can be replaced by the flat screen led which is further developed into oled. to avoid eye irritating and have high picture quality. thats why tv picture quality has gotten so much better over the years. japan consumer company brought the digital tv to the market using remote to change the channel. today so many serials are available to see through tv. i think it is just the most popular cereals you see on the tv. you know frosted flakes and cheerios. lol. yes through ads revenue comes to the tv channel and soon reach the people as faster. true dat. do you watch south park at all. car is wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation safety carrying the people which is have new technology to have rear camera disc braking system. awesome. how do you know so much. cars also have trunks. most of the cars in 2010 have internal combustion engine. hydrocarbons fuels are cause the pollution in the environment. so only electric cars are used in some part of the world to avoid pollution. i would say over time that will get more steam and more people will have them. i think they need to get cheaper. most the government is worried about the vehicle safety. so the manufactures have adopt new safety techniques in the vehicles to safe guard the people inside it. safety is very important. to avoid environment pollution some countries using ethanol as fuel. some have using electric cars. very interesting. have a good one. do you still listen to the radio. i don't as much as i used to. hi same here. i sometimes listen through the radio when i am in the car. now i am curious to listen to some unusual programs like one that is broadcasted in latin. have you ever heard about that i have not. i wonder who the audience is for that since it is a dead language exactly and it has been kind of succesful because it has been broadcast since 1989 wow. that's very strange. did you know that on an am radio you can pick up jupiter's radio storms because they are so strong no i did not know that. i think that is amazing to think how far the signal comes from.. i agree. did you also know that you can make a radio with very little i do not know but i imagine is not that complicated how can it be done wwii soldiers could make them with a razorblade and pencil. wow that is really simple.. did you know if you listened to the radio in canada at least 40% of what you heard would be canadian music is that by choice or is it some kind of law it is actually by law. i think is an advantage for canadian musicians i can see how that would benefit them but i find it odd that it was such an issue that it had to be made a law. i agree with you. have you ever heard radio dramas my parents told me they were popular when they were kids. i know that they were very popular before tv. i wonder if they hold up i think is exciting because is like reading a book. but i heard there is a website where you can listen for thousands of dramas for free i would try that. i would too. do you also watch a lot of tv not that much but there are a few shows i watched. among them is not pokemon.. i hear that there have been an insane number of episodes for that cartoon. more than 750... that is too much. i like the simpsons much more that is too much. it does not seem like it's been on that long. it was nice chatting with you. have a nice day. do you by chance follow barbara alston did you like her music i haven't ever heard any of her songs but i know of her. what about you i know some of here songs one of them is da doo ron ron and also had other hit songs. too bad she died. i know it's very sad. i realize now that i have heard of one song but i did not know that gerry goffin and carole king wrote it he hit me (it felt like a kiss). i'm surprised that they would write that song i know a little bit about their story from the carole king musical beautiful and that was surprising. yeah she did she also sang theres no other like my baby this song was in the charts back in 1962 i think it was on place #20. she was very successful and it's sad that she died from flu complications. that family has experienced a lot of heartache recently especially considering that their child tony/toni alston was murdered in 2010 possibly for being transgender. i heard about that he was shot in 2010 and the worst part is that his murder remains unsolved. so sad to see how hate got tony killed. hate gets a lot of people killed these days unfortunately. that's why i like that we have television which can not only spread news but also spread humor and joy. i love weekend update on snl i think it's a very humorous way to talk about some news that might otherwise be pretty dark. and i love the simpsons. do you know anything about the simpsons i love the simpsons i am a big fan did you know there is an episode where bart doesnt appear.. wow i did not know that that's very surprising. i sometimes think about how often there are guest stars/cameos of celebrities. i especially found it funny when daniel radcliffe voiced edward cullen on the simpsons' twilight parody. have you seen that episode i havent seen that episode i might google it later whats it about can you give me a short preview please. i don't want to spoil it for you you should look it up later though. i wonder what would happen if they had made a simpsons episode of the crystals. that would be very dramatic and informative. would you watch an episode like that i would sure watch itwho knows maybe there is one lol i would like to watch barbara alston and the rest of the crew come to life again in the simpsons. yes me too. i think they could make a really interesting plot with the drama around the producer (phil spector) and how he was later convicted of murdering lana clarkson. knowing the simpsons it would probably be a little distasteful but probably funny. it would be funny. so what other shows do you like to watch maybe pokemon i also enjoy watching the office parks and rec family guy rick and morty and some other shows like that. i started watching the marvelous mrs. maisel and found that really funny but i just keep rewatching the office because it's so addictive. what shows do you watch pokemon i used to love pokemon but now theres about 750 so i lost track of it i also like south park seems like the producers have a good relation with the crew of the simpsons. i never really got into pokemon. i enjoy south park but i am not a huge fan of it and don't watch it religiously. i also love community which is by the same producers as rick and morty. i see community is a nice show i like it. so what other hobbies do you have maybe cars i like listening to music a lot. that is why i am surprised that i hadn't heard much music from barbara alston and the crystals. were you surprised to find out that she initially won a talent show with the delphi thezonians i wonder what that name even means. well you lost me there lol her family sure misses her but she left an important legacy behind. did you hear about barbara alston died recently she was 74 i am actually not sure who she is was she an actress i was just reading about the fact that after wwii an improved version of black and white became popular. no she's a famous singer she was in the group the crystals they made that song da do ron ron i think everyone knows that one haha oh yes thats a fun song. have you ever seem thomas the tank engine i saw that ringo starr george carlin and alec baldwin have all narrated it for at least 52 episodes each yes i've seen that show especially when i was a kid i love george carlin i just wish he did some dirty jokes when he did the narration lol lol i saw that their is only one episode of the simpsons where bart neither appears or is mentioned yeah i didn't see that episode i did see the one where south park makes fun of family guy did you hear that afterwards the simpsons creator sent them flowers oh wow that is funny. i read that there are over 750 episodes of pokemon. thats about 50 a year for 16 straight years that's incredible. i love watching it as a kid i would never be able to see them all now though did you ever watch that 70s show i did. i thought it was interesting that it was renamed and made verbatim in the uk. yep and then it was canceled after only 10 episodes lol they must have a different sense of humor over there yes exactly. this is totally off the subject. something interesting i saw was that mcdonalds added the drive thru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing fatigues that is really nice of them. it also has made it easier for me to be lazy lol do you know why the trunk of the car is called the trunk by the way i think i saw somewhere that old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back yep you're right that's the reason. good thing we don't have flamethrowers on our cars like they do in south africa or they would be a real fire hazard with a wooden trunk lol lol yes that wouldve been bad. i saw that the car brand cadillac was named after french explorer antoine de la mothe cadillac. long name. yep that's where they got the name for the car company cadillac from that guy founded detroit i'm actually from michigan and i didn't know that haha oh wow. do they have a cadillac museum in michigan no but they do have some plants that make cadillac cars though did you ever play the video game gran turismo by the way yes i saw that jann mardenborough became a professional racecar driver by beating 90000 people in that game impressive i wonder how it transfers from a video game into real world car racing skills though what do you think about the radio to do you think that its useful to listen to when you're driving good afternoon. do you have a favorite tv show hello there i do i really like the simpsons how about you the simpsons is an all time great show and i do enjoy it my favorite is probably seinfeld hey that's my 2nd if i can't have two number ones wish simpsons would have quit while they were still funny like seinfeld. right. i'm not sure if/when simpsons will quit being a cartoon makes it easy for the character to just keep going. seinfeld finale as most great shows was kinda disappointing. yeah it was do you know there is an episode of the simpsons in which bart never appears that seems unlikely but i trust you i wonder which episode it was and what it was about pretty hard to have an episode without a main character. i am willing to bet it was in a later season episode i don't think i have seen it. i have a buddy who claims to have seen every episode of the simpsons i'll ask him if he knows. maybe test his knowledge yeah i bet he would know or maybe not that seems like an odd fact. right like they didn't advertise the episode as the only on without bart. you'd have to watch it in real time and make the connection. but it's probably widely known to the fanatics by now. yeah i agree have you ever seen an episode of pokemon i can't say that i have but i do know about pokemon and what they are and how crazy kids are about it. pocket monster. oh yeah the kids are crazy about it for sure did you know there are over 750 episodes of the show though. that i had no idea seems like a ton of shows for me to not have seen even one. yeah i never saw one i don't know how they can keep coming up with new material. i think the story lines with that many characters would be hard to create and follow. there is a movie coming out with ryan reynolds right yeah i think you are right i thought i saw a preview recently. do you listen to the radio much podcasts etc yeah i found a really good local station that i like how about you at work i listed to a lot of talk radio sports and politics to pass the time. at home i listen to a lot of music but not on a traditional radio station. i listen to podcasts while walking the dogs too. nice. i have yet to get into the podcasts. anyways it's been fun and interesting talking with you i hope you enjoy the rest of your day. hello do you like cars yes i like cars but i really like race cars. i like all kinds pretty much. i did not know ford did manufacture a car on 1908. if i'm not wrong the ford was the first car built do you remember the talk about henry t ford it was called the model t.i do not remember the talk tell me about it. i don't know much about it the ford was built by the ford company from 1908 until 1927. the car crank from the front. they replaced pretty much animals drawing carriages yes they did. did you know a german by the name of karl benz invented the mercedes benz yes i did learned about that. 1886 was a key year for him and for the automobile industry. can you imagine buying property and find a burn full of classic cars. how is this possible unless it was purchase from a millionaire of course. i had never learned of that happening. but i learned of someone becoming a professional car race when beating 90.000 players of gran turismo video game. wow that amazing do you watch tv if yes what is your most watch show i do not watch much tv i did before and sometimes watched the simpsons what about you. i like tv a lot and the internet. watching tv gave me a comfort feeling what do you do in place of tv i watch more youtube. did you know that in the simpsons there is one episode where bart is ignored. i heard about it but i only watched a few episode of the simpsons. i did watch it a lot what i almost never watched is pokemon which has more than 750 episodes. yes that was shocking to me even known i wasn't a big fan of pokemon only the games i like the game. it is very popular but the amount of tv episodes were so many that it would equal 50 episodes for 16 years in a row. wow it's hard to believe a cartoon show running that many episodes for so long i can amazing how busy the cartoon artists were. well it was nice talking to you.. have a good one hi how are you i'm doing well thanks. i've been watching tv today or telly as some like to call it. are you a tv watcher i am. what have you been watching i was watching that old south park episode where they parody family guy. was it any good yeah. it was so good that the producers received flowers from the simpson's crew upon it's airing. do you ever watch the simpson's i do watch the simpsons. do you watch the simpsons occasionally. i recently heard that there was only one of the simpson's episodes where bart never appeared or was mentioned. impressive for how many episodes have been aired. yes it was the four women and the manicure. it was a good one. did you know that there are over 750 episodes of pokemon do you watch that show i missed all 750 episodes. pretty impressive run though. how many years did that show run 16 straight years. my son loves it so i think i have seen them all through proxy. i cannot remember a single one though. but they haunt your dreams right that's like me and that 70s show. i watched but don't remember them. what.s even more crazy the show was remade in england the first 10 episodes but the show tanked. i guess it did not translate well to english. was that days like these did you ever see the british version of the office it is in my queue of shows to watch but i loved the us version so much i fear it will be anti climactic. you know what else was anti climactic when alec baldwin became the new narrator for thomas the tank engine. i preferred george carlin although ringo starr did a pretty good job too. they all did voices on that show yup. at least 52 episodes each. that show has been on forever but not as long as pokemon. not much has been on as long as pokemon. were you aware that mcdonalds created the drive thru in 1975 i did not know that. crazy how it has been adopted everywhere now. you know what i would like to see get adopted everywhere equipping cars with flamethrowers. they actually allow that in south africa. that's overkill. i wonder if they do not have effective police or bar b que is really popular. the cadillac brand created by a dude named antoine de la mothe used to be really popular. but his name never caught on. nice chatting with you. hi how are you do you listen to the radio about 45 minutes on my commute you i used to listen quite a bit when i was younger. now i go to youtube and listen to jazz albums. yeah i do spotify and pandora now. there is a website for classical radio dramas for free i wonder who visits the site. i probably is popular among the older set. the kids like vids. did you know ww2 soldiers made radios from pencils and razorblades i cant imagine ever being that ingenious. i wonder who thought that up. that is quite a feat. just need waves and a conductor. i suppose that is true. would you listen to the news in latin on the radio i wouldnt but many must since a finnish station has been broadcasting yeah since 1989. i guess there are some dedicated latin fans over there in finland. lol probably difficult to do in canada. yes canada requires 40% canadian content yeah so the news in latin would have to 40% about canada. the snow forecast the igloo housing starts. lol how about jupiter it has its own radio waves. yes the storms on jupiter are audible. there is a radio station that turns solar activity into music too. wow neat. do you watch tv too i sometimes watch tv. usually when i am exercising. you same here. the simpsons a lot. i heard there is an episode where bart is not in it yeah i dont remember the name. something like bart isnt dead i forget. anyway great chat. weird since he is the star. thanks have a great day. same to you did you hear about that police officer that got sentenced to 15 years in prison yea what kind of abuse of power is this i know right 15 years is a harsh penalty but she deserved it she committed a murder and used power to cover it up do you generally trust cops a regular person may have gotten more time. i trust some of them but a lot of them are abusive just like officer sherry hall her report was full of lies makes me really angry its a good thing the georgia bureau of investigation looked into the shooting yea. did you know cars came into global use in the 20th century really in the 20th century i though it was a lot longer than that i wonder who made the first model i think it was henry ford. i'm just glad they evolved to electric vehicles now. we have over 1.25 billion vehicles on earth. thats a lot of cars did you hear about that pro driver that picked up his skills by playing gran turismo this is so sick. i used to play that game all day as a kid. it was very difficult. did you every play it i just to play it yeah i wasnt good at it though it was a great game trunk of cars are called like that because of wooden trunks on the back that's cool. what do you know about radios i know the carry waves in the form of sound info music just about any sound really i like radios i think they are a great invention did you know that by canada law their music has to be at least 40% canadian i think thats a great law its a good way to promote local talent bieber and drake are great canadian artists of course. it is just kind of weird. i did not know bieber was canadian. do you subscribe to radio or do you just listen to free radio no not really do you know any free radio websites i know pandora has a free version. i might download it you know that jupiter has storms that are so strong am radio picks them up. i had no idea that's insane. that is insane just like soldiers and how they knew how to make radios back in wwii i agree. hi do you watch tv yes. i'm watching tv now. nice. do you like the simpsons i have seen all of them. there is one where bart is not seen or mentioned. yeah that is a little strange wonder what happened to the voice actor do you watch pokemon sometimes. do they still air yes i think so .there are over 750 episodes. wow but i guess they have been around for 16 years yes. that's a long time did you know alec baldwin narrated thomas the tank engine for at least 52 episodes yeah as well as george carlin and ringo starr yep. do youisten to the radio i do. maybe one of these days i will catch jupiter's storms that would be cool. they storms are so strong. you have to listen to am that is cool. do you like radio dramas yes. isn't there a sight where you can get thousands for free. yeah that is so convenient for those who love that type of drama it really is. do you drive a car i do. do you know how cadillac got its name yes after the french explorer who founded detroit. yeah antoine de la moth you can put flamethrowers on your car in south africa. wow way to go for them. nice chat hello how are you doing today i'm good thanks and you i'm doing good thanks. do you like television i watch a little. do you not too much. there are over 750 episodes of pokemon. i know i had heard that i don't see what people find interesting about that at all. do you i am not into pokemon. do you like the simpons yes i love the simpsons. did you know that there is only one episode in which bart doesn't appear in i've heard that and i don't remember ever seeing that one. do you i haven't watched too many simpson's episodes so i didn't see that one. that's cool. do you know they remade that 70s show in the uk it was called days like these oh wow i didn't know that. it looks like it only made it 10 episodes before it was cancelled. true i guess it didn't translate well across the pond i'm thinking it didn't. do you like cars yes i got me a big old american made cadillac. nice. i'm more into motorcycles but like cars too. did you know the trunk of your car is called a trunk because older cars actually had a wooden trunk in them> figured that was the case about the trunks. do you know the guy my cadillac is named after was a french explorer that founded detroit i did not know that. it's legal in south africa to equip your car with a flamethrower to deter carjackings. my cadillac needs a few of those mounted on its hood for traffic in the city. well it was really good talking to you. you too friend. enjoy the rest of your afternoon. do you watch any television shows i watch quite a bit of murder mysteries on hallmark. what about you nice that is awesome. i need to check them out. i watch family guy and south park sometimes ever watch those no they aren't really my kind of show. i don't go in for raunchy comedy. i can't believe how long they have been on the air though. yea they are pretty raunchy. one time south park made fun of family guy and the simpsons sent them flowers nice. they seem to get a lot of actors to do voice over work on their shows though so it must pay well. for sure. did you ever watch pokemon growing up they have like 750 episodes. i didn't watch it growing up but i do now. i have some pokemon obssessed kids. i think we have probably seen all 750. i think i have also lol. thomas the tank was good too they had famous people voicing thomas they really do. i just can't get behind some of these reality shows nowdays. some are so obviously fake. for sure lol. did you ever watch that 70s show i liked that growing up i used to watch it a lot in college. it was a good mind numbing show to watch after class. for sure lol. it had a lot of good stars in it that got their break after that. too bad the uk version didn't have success. yeah that is too bad. i would love to see more plays adapted into movies. i don't get to the theatre much so that would be fun to watch. yea i would like that also movies need to get a little better. do you listen to the radio much not as much as i would like to. i love music. what about you do you like the radio i love the radio i like oldies. apparently in canada they have a law where they have to play at least 40% of their songs on the radio. i don't think i could do it as long as it isn't a 40% justin beiber playlist i think i could handle that. i was thinking the same thing lol. it was so nice talking with you. i could stand to listen to 40% of alanis morisette though. i could too i never knew she was canadian that would be a fun road trip in canada lol have a good night. i think we should stop publicizing mass killers. that is what they want. hello i completely agree. they shouldn't gain fame over destroying the lives of others. the families are forced to relive it over and over again. they want their faces splashed on every screen. they even write about it about how the more you kill the more limelight you get. everyone wants exposure these days it's sad. kinda like the tv show shark tank which i'm a big fan of. they have lots of people just going on asking for crazy deals just to gain exposure for there product. the exposure need crosses all lines. yeah.pokemon is overexposed. 50 episodes a year for 16 years straight. i've literally watched 2 episodes of pokemon and never any of the real games. do you watch much telly well i prefer music. but the other day i turned on thomas the tank engine and heard ringo starr nice crossover ringo in thomas the tank engine. music is universal and mixes so well into all parts of life. speaking of which i'll be seeing sir paul in concert this summer. it's the beatles but it's close enough. i'm a big music fan as well i always have some form of radio playing in the background. watch out for canadian radio.it's like all rush celene dion and bryan adams 24/7 it seems. haha i'd rather listen to the sun. did you know there is a radio station that actually translates the sun's solar activities allowing you to listen to music the sun makes. that's crazy. i wonder if wwii soldiers could hear it.using their foxhole radios i doubt we had the technology at the time but that would have gotten them through the night. they were listening to old time shows like radio ventriloquists. think about that one for a moment. you could be the worst ventriloquist ever on the radio. george carlin is perfect for radio. caught him on tank engine too. i really need to check out this tank engine show it seems the happening place to be. alec baldwin is there as well giving trump a break i guess. lol crazy... that's almost as wild as google's self driving cars having an aggressive mode. i bet the horn honks super aggressively. maybe they are aggressively searching. i'd like to explore france in a cadillac. did you know there is arrow next to pump symbol reminding you which side on the car the pump goes in. that is handy when renting and you're not sure. it should always be in the left side so micky dees could make a drive in where you fill up too. the soldiers would appreciate it i think. anyway i have to bolt like im in a grand turismo game. take care. micky dees do you mean mcdonalds i worked there when i was 15 it was my first job. i walked to work each day. my parents wouldn't drive me as it was up to me to learn responsibility. i started in the winter and it was cold. i bought new gloves to keep my feet warm. then i bought a new jacket because it was cold to walk to work. i saved up enough eventually to buy a piece of crap car. it didn't even have a radio but the horn sure did honk. yeah.it's slang for mcdonalds.at least when i was young. however when i was young the trunks on cars were made of wood. nice chatting with you. do you like mcdonalds not really but i know they invented the drive thru yeah i wonder why for soldiers yeah because they were not allowed to get out of the car interesting is that a military rule it used to be but it no longer is however we still have drive thrus yeah. well what is crazy is that apparently it is legal in south africa to equip your car with flame throwers. wow. do you listen to the radio much not a lot but sometimes. apparently you can make one out of a razor blade. and a pencil right like soldiers used to do yeah i think you needed a pencil. you could make one but in canada 40% of the music would be canadian. wow that is a lot of radio time with just canadian music yeah it is. it is a law up there apparently. talk about weird. yeah go figure. do you lke radio dramas i do apparently you can listen to thousands of them for free. yeah that is so cool. do you watch much tv yeah i like the simpsons. have you seen it yes i love the show. bart has not appeared in only one episode apparently interesting i'm surprised he's even missed one he is the whole point of the show. well him and homer. haha so true. too dumb and too funny at the same time yeah. well at least it has been successful unlike the remake of that 70s show that was done in the uk. nice chatting with you. i really like that mcdonalds added drive thru's for soldiers. that is cool. i do wonder if that was the very first drive through. thats a good question. i used to work the drive thru at mcdonald's. it was not my favorite job. i liked working at a radio station better. yeah fast food definitely is a difficult job to do. nice connection to the soldier comment too the radio thing and what not. the soldiers building a radio out of a razor blade. macgeyver stuff yeah i dont think i could do that . when i worked at the radio i cant remember having to play any specific amount of us music. funny. agreed. that canadian law seemed a bit restrictive. i guess it is mostly there to ensure that their citizens are exposed to their own art. thats a good thought. i would rather have canadian music than listen to an exclusive show in latin. ha. yeah. i've traveled a lot and even have been to finland but never noticed that. might not be a popular station. yeah i dont think it gets many listeners. even hearing the storm from jupiter would be better than latin. mhm. though i have to admit that i probably wouldn't know what jupiter sounds like. definitely not like latin or a radio drama. p yeah i dont know what id be in for either with jupiter. maybe id rather listen to thomas the train engine and see if i could pick out the ones that ringo starr narrates. i actually didn't know that he or george carlin narrated that. that's amusing considering george carlin's general comedy. he probably would have seemed more at home on south park when he was alive. i agree sp would have been more his style. that or maybe the simpsons. hm. simpsons seems to have had sooooo many guest starts over the years. i wouldn't be shocked if carlin was actually on it. i'm gonna look that one up later. still a little shocked that after 20+ seasons they only had one non bart appearance. thats exactly what i was thinking. hes such a huge part of the show. i wonder which one he wasn't in . probably took the day off or something. speaking of taking the day off apparently there are so many pokemon eps that you might actually need to take a day off to marathon it. im not a huge fan but i could see there being sooo many episodes. over 750 episodes right almost as many as there are pokemon. ah i dont even know how many their are. you gotta catch em all. yeah i think that both simpsons south park and pokemon and thomas are definitely some of the longest running shows. interesting connection there. it is. have a great day. you too thanks. np do you ever watch the bachelorette no never. anything interesting about it. i don't watch it either but apparently one of the episodes was interrupted with footage of trump and the north korean leader kim jong un snl did a skit about that i think. people were not happy about that interruption. it is pretty funny that people are comparing the meeting to the show it interrupted. it definitely affects the world more than that episode would have true.i guess people are just tired of being manipulated and lied to. i'm mean the whole thing is like one big reality tv show and i guess they like the bachelorette more. right. whereas the people who care more about politics probably weren't even watching the show. it must be interesting to watch several guys vying for one girl's attention. one of the guys fell off a top bunk and ended up in the hospital i agree wholeheartedly with you. i think both shows are degrading the one for the men and the one for the women. who knows where will will end up with this nonsense. on a lighter note the visiting locker room for iowa state university is painted pink. that's pretty awesome. what's also funny is that in the 50s the top bowlers made more money than top football players that is interesting. i think it was at least twice as much. i heard in the 60's there was a game played and the score was 222 0. i would not have wanted to be on the bus home for the losing team. that's a lot of touchdowns. especially considering how the points are calculated. there's a former patriots player who never fumbled the ball in his career how long was his career ha ha. there has only been one quarterback that was left handed. i've heard that. another funny aspect of football is that the superimposed yellow line for the first down won espn an emmy you know i gotta say they deserve it i was very appreciative of that line. correction that high scoring game was played in 1916 by georgia tech and cumberland. it would be in college football. it's interesting how the interpretation of the name depends on the region. in some countries football is understood as what americans know as soccer yeah you're right and in others like australia it's considered rugby. i think there's a difference between rugby and australian rules football. there's even a variation known as gaelic football yeah apparently there are so many different variations that they have football codes. you know trump with all his money doesn't rate as one of the wealthiest presidents. i guess jfk washington and jefferson all had more money. i wonder if with washington and jefferson they had to calculate the hundreds of years of inflation to figure that out probably can you imagine trump and hillary pres & vp. apparently thats the way it was the runner up was automatically the vp. i'm glad things have changed since then. it would be strange to live in a house knowing it would only last 4 8 years but apparently the guest house is larger anyway hello do you like football i watch it every now and then this latest superbowl was very boring though. i didnt watch the latest one. thats too bad. did you know bowlers in the 60's made almost twice as much as football players yeah and the university of iowas locker room is all pink for visiting teams haha. thats cool probably some scare tactic or mind game. and did you know that patriots rb benjarvus green ellis never fumbled a football in his entire nfl career yeah i read that that is amazing.. that has to be some kind of record lol espn won an award for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line in american football that's pretty cool. that line is really helpful for people at home. so how do you feel about kim jong un not a fan lol i think its funny that no one knows how old he actually is. if i had to venture a guess i would say early thirties but that's just a guess and he isn't telling lol he claims to have learned to drive at age 3. yeah it says he was born in 1983 but korea has a different way of aging people. so when you are born in korea you are already one year old and the first year you have a korean new years you are 2 years old lol did you know the onion voted kim jong un as the sexiest man alive and the chinese believes it talk about gullible ha. who is the onion the onion is an online news website that only post satire and joke news so everything they report is fake but a lot of people fall for it all the time especially on facebook. oooooh weird. yeah i dont believe he learned to drive at age 3 either. he also has started to edit pictures to depict a different history just as previous leaders like stalin did. seriously. apparently north korea is undergoing renovations of their theme parks under his orders..priorities lol that is if the theme parks even exist at all. since they don't let anyone in to see we will never know. ah thats true it could be all lies. north korea is a country i don't prefer to visit yeah well it was nice chatting with you have a good night. did you realize kim jong un was born in 1983 i did not he's only one year older than me. one month and one year to be precise. he is 9 months older than me. hes been running a country since 2011. what have i been doing with my life. lol he's running a country while his older brother is going to eric clapton concerts. that doesn't seem right. i wonder why his older brother didnt take over for their father or is it not like that i'm not sure. his half brother was favored to be the heir but fell out of favor when he was caught with a fake passport trying to enter tokyo disneyland. he is pretty violent he even ordered his own uncle to be executed. i wonder if his uncle was a barber. i heard he cuts his own hair because he is scared of barbers. is that a fear from childhood it seems odd that one wouldnt overcome something like that. it is kind of odd. i wonder if he watched sweeny todd i heard that he is renovating their theme parks. then he just has to avoid fleet street and hes all good. that is right. it is good that him and trump have been having talks. that hasn't happened in years. hopefully those talks are productive and are good for the us. i hope so too. did you know that the only us president to have a phd is woodrow wilson i guess you don't have to be scholarly to be president. i think our current president really proves that one. i agree with that. did you know that 5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote the greatest margin was 10%. wow i knew some lost the popular vote but never knew the margin got that big. thats pretty incredible. yeah it is. did you know lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration and can you guess who else was in that photo it was john wilkes booth. how creepy. that is pretty creepy. i am curious to see where he was positioned in the photo it is just so odd. i would like to see that too. i'm going to have to research it. i mean was the assassination planed out further than we think i wonder if they are in other photos together too. i'm not sure it is kind of eerie. well i think i am going to have to go look into this now. i hope you have a good night. hello. do watch any nfl games yes i'm a chiefs fan. i was surprised that the nfl has no rules against women playing. go girls. it is surprising. seeing as how no women play yet i assumed they did have rules against it. i also can't believe that there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in an average nfl game. is that right it seems like much longer. i mean i know there's a lot of commercials and such but it still seems like the actual plays take a while and are more frequent. i played in hs and there was a lot of standing around but that seems like too little time. maybe tracking chips in shoulder pads will help keep track of time better oh yeah i've heard about that. they are used to track a players every move on the field. they are even in the footballs to track it's movements. do you think the teams get and use any of the information recorded probably. do you watch basketball in 39 of 50 states the highest paid state employee is a college football or basketball coach. i watch some basketball but more football actually. college football and basketball is great to watch. did you ever hear about the dunk shot being banned from college basketball for a while i think so. kareem. is it racist for new zealand to call their basketball team the tall blacks. it would be in the u.s. whether it was meant to be or not. i don' t think it's racist. if the team is made up of tall people that are black then it is just descriptive. what do you think i agree. i didn't know there was a basketball court on the top of the us supreme court building. dunk one ruth bader ginsberg. yep. it's called the highest court in the land. somehow i have a hard time picturing a lot of the justices playing not just her. i sometimes have a hard time picturing them actually following the us constitution. do you keep track of nfl qbs alex smith must be smart. he quizzed out of his first two years of college. i didn't know that about him. i know he's a good quarterback though. baker mayfield has some talent off the field as well. he considered being a pro gamer instead of quarterback. i remember the circular huddle. i didn't know that a deaf qb was its origin. oh yeah someone told me that recently. a team didn't want the other team to read his hand signals so they huddled up and the huddle was born. i always thought it just to communicate verbally better. did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed qa in the nfl no i didn't. to be honest though i've never paid attention to what hand they throw the ball out of. me either. times have changed with an nfl qb has to decide between football and video games. such is the plight for baker mayfield. he's just a super competitive person. i imagine he'd be great either way. well it's been nice chatting with you. have a great day. hello do you watch the nfl hi i sure do. did you know women can play too yeah that is nice that there is no written rule against that if you make the cut you play yeah that is true. did you know the average game has only 11 minutes of active play yeah and yet we are glued to the tv for hours waiting for it to end ah the irony if it. and engineers seems to make more money on the long run than them yes their careers are much longer so i guess that makes sense good point. did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders oh about not being able to eat in the same place as the players yeah that is so sexist and outdated and i really think it needs to go now yes and the worst part is that they have to leave mid meal if they walk in yes pretty rough.they are using tracking chips on the players now it seems yeah and they are tracing velocity and speed and a bunch of other stuff with those yeah i hope they can use those to make the game safer for the players too i hope so too how about basketball watch it much sometimes i do. do you know who made the dunk shot popular yes it was kareem but he was also the reason why it was banned for a few years yeah that is true he was just too good at it and it was for a good chunk 10 years yeah. do you know who invented the sport of basketball yes it was james naismith and he is also the only losing coach at u of kansas wow what an irony really. the coaches are the highest paid though as far as state employees go that is true in most states. have you heard of the highest court in the land hi hi there. are you a sports fan yes i like football do like football i liked it a lot in high school but tickets are so expensive now so i just watch it on tv. i'm still wondering when a woman will start playing since it isn't against the rules. yeah me too i stop seeing nfl on tv not trying to get tickets i guess the most logical place for a women to start would be as a kicker. since the average game has only 11 minutes of live play the kicker must only play for about 2 minutes a game. do you have favorite nfl team where we can add a kicker i like the cowboys and the falcons. i was surprised to see that engineers make more than football players over their life time. i guess because most only play for a few years before they get hurt. i like redskins why do you think the saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in what's their reasoning to avoid any gossip s and controversy probably but why doesn't the player have to leave if the cheerleader comes in it isn't fair. it's discrimination don't you think totally unfair . but the nfl has business motives. did you study about james naismith the inventor of basketball in school. i did and for some reason i an still remember that name even though i've never been a basketball fan. funny that he was a the only losing coach at uk. i think he lost the match as a coach in kansas he is the only one to lose i guess he didn't lose a match he was the only losing coach in their history. that means he never had a season where they won more than they lost. i guess you don't know much about basketball either. yep poor me . but i know one thing there is a basket ball court on top of us supreme court building right. that is funny 'the highest court in the land'. that's a good basketball joke. i wonder if the justices actually play up there in their robes ha ha. i guess its safe till there is no football court above supreme court. they have to handle quarterbacks . much worse i don't know why the new zealand basketball team is named the tall blacks. do you not sure . but they are associated with black uniforms in other sports too i never thought about new zelanders being tall. oh well. funny that tom brady was a backup quarter back that never got into a game in high school. boy i bet they wish they could change that. what a history of 4 time superbowl champion hi there are you a football fan i was a big fan age and other concerns have made me stop and you i was reading about adrian peterson. me too. i'm a viking fan who is a bit conflicted about ap. hahahah why he was really fun to watch before i learned about his child abuse story. wow was he abused so sorry about that. no he abused his son. he did play well last season though. wow. so terrible news. perhaps he was abused too. you know those things happens as a cycle. i love quaterbacks do you happen to have a favorite favorite to watch might be aaron rodgers at his best. how about you> hahaha it was a long time ago stabler did you know him was stabler a cowboy no from the evil oakland's raiders perhaps you are too young. i think they are the most important player in the game well as well as receivers etc. etc. definitely. crazy to think that alex smith worked to get a masters degree after getting a ba in just two years he really worked hard. and he began working on a master´s degree. has to do something after football and he broke his leg badly this year so he might be done. well but sure he has a lot of money left. i never knew that the circular huddle was invented for a deaft quaterback so the other team could not read his hand signals cool. now they use both headsts and hand signals. did you know that the new zealand's basketball team are nicknamed the tall blacks i should google why later. maybe they are referring to coffee you are right. i don´t know i like to investigate things i will do it later reading that the inventor of basketball james naismith is the only losing coach in kansas history. poor guy. interesting. what's your favorite thing to watch on tv i really like comedy shows. i enjoy reality shows. did you ever watch thomas the tank engine i saw that ringo starr george carlin and alec baldwin have narrated i like those shows too. i've never seen much of the thomas show. it must be very popular if those guys are involved. maybe they'll have the president narrate sometime yes that would be neat. i saw that there is only one episode of the simpsons where bart neither appears nor is mentioned i watched the simpon's a lot when i was younger. i think they've even done parodies of some of the us presidents on that show. south park was another good comedy cartoon tv show. yes i saw that when they aired their last episode that the simpsons crew sent them flowers that's really nice. do you think they ever watch the simpson's at the president's house like his family and stuff im not sure but i saw that the top three wealthiest presidents were jfk washington and jefferson oh yes. did you hear of the president of indonesia and his three pop albums lol thats funny. i saw though that the first president of zimbabwe was ccalled president banana i wonder if president banana had a feast of banana dishes and puddings at his inauguration does the us president still have a produce garden at the white house i am not sure about that but that would be nice. did you know that the us presidents guest house is larger than the white house that's pretty amazing. was there ever a president to have his home on that mtv cribs show that would be interesting. until 1805 in the us the runner up in a presidential elecction automatically became vice president do you think that's better than how they do the separate elections now do you think trump would have wanted it to be hillary as vice lol wow that would have been an interesting match up. lol. do you enjoy music i saw something about two identical twins from japan released a rap album when turned 100 years old in 1992 have you heard about do nguyen mai khoi she's the vietnamese pop star that ran for president to raise awareness. i didn't know about that. i just read that even though this album was released over 40 years ago the dark side of the moon is still one of the best selling albums of 2014 yes such a great classic album. i've enjoyed listening to it many times. i was just gonna say that you should look that pop singer up. i wish america would have someone like her to actually run. did you know that linkin parks hybrid theory is the best selling album of the 21st century. wow i would not have guessed that although i do like them. i once saw them live on some tv special. they have quite a few good albums. have you heard about singer mai khoi is she that vietnamese pop star that only performs in secret i just read an article about her. yes that is her. i am glad she finally got to play some shows in brooklyn. that is cool. did you know she ran for political office in vietnam interesting. was that when she won the prize for creative dissent i do not think it was. i think it was more for her lyrics. i would like to check out her album dissent sometimes. did you know that unless one has the backing of the communist party in vietnam there is no chance of winning an election i am glad many places are republics with a president. me too. speaking of presidents did you know that lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration that is interesting. i wonder if jfk was photographed more frequently since he is so wealthy. maybe. did you know that john wilkes booth was also in that picture nope did not know that. did you know the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana. really that is kind of awesome. did you know the only us president to have a ph. d. was woodrow wilson must have been a smart guy. today he would probably appear on television. probably would. since you brought up tv did you know that the skit weekend update on snl is their longest running skit that is interesting. it has been around longer than the simpsons which is quite an accomplishment. that is true. did you know that in the first 400 episodes of the simpsons homer has had 188 jobs pretty funny. there is only one episode of the simpsons where bart is not present and doesn't even get mentioned. really i had not idea. did you know that in the episode treehouse of horror xxi daniel radcliffe voiced the parody of edward cullen pretty amazing. i think i will go watch that south park episode admired by the simpsons crew. that is cool. nice chatting with you have a good day. have you heard of do nguyen mai khoi no who is he she is a vietnamese pop star that is considered an enemy of the state due to her song lyrics. that's interesting. i do know that bob marley has been on the album chart for 914 weeks. really. i had no idea. what do you think of linkin park's album being the best selling of the 21st century i never would have thought of that. i would've thought it would be jackson or elvis. that is one of my favorite bands. i am still shocked and sad the lead singer commited suicide. i know that was a big shock. record album charts are a strange thing indeed. i mean dark side of the moon is still one of the best selling albums. floyd is another one of my favorite bands. do you like aerosmith i heard they made more money from the video game guitar hero than any of their albums. i do and i've heard that too. i guess it's just a sign of the times changing. vinyl lps are hardly sold anymore. i had them when i was younger. my wife and i finally trashed them because they were so heavy when the boxes were full of them when we moved to new houses. wish we hadn't would probably make a lot of money selling them today. you probably would have. they are collectors items to some people. some of the really old ones are 78 rpm records in a book. i never had them. i had the 35s when i was really young as a kid. did you know walmart only sells clean versions of albums and if the artist won't make one they won't sell it i knew they banned certain magazines and books but not albums. i guess that can be a good thing when you think of all of the kids in the stores. i had audio cassettes from the 70s into the first decade of the 2000s. but got rid of them too. i think it is neat that you can just tell siri to play a song and she'll play the song. world is a lot different from when i was a kid. i hear you there. now even elected officials make albums. i mean the president of indonesia made 3 pop albums. wonder if an audiobook is considered an an album. if so the audio version of the art of the deal would be his. don't think any other sitting presidents have albums. none come to mind at the moment. presidents have different functions though depending on the form of government so that president may have a lighter role than others. i was surprised that five us presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote. the greatest margin was 10%. even more surprising is that the runner up used to become the vice president. wow can you imagine trump and hillary working together that would've been crazy. snl would have a blast with that. did you know weekend update was on the first episode and is their longest running skit no but i think that's their best one. i like that pokemon has over 750 episodes. hey there what is your favorite music album i enjoy listening to most albums such as the dark side of the moon or frank sinatra's hits like fly me to the moon oh ya pink floyd is awesome. i'm glad that ya dark side of the moon is still a best selling record even today i think great music is timeless and always appreciated by future generations ya i think so did you hear about the japanese 100 year old rapping twins i bit. tell me more well they made an album when they both turned 100 its a rap album and came out in 1992 it sounds wacky to me it is cool those twins did something memorable together though i have no clue how the music itself was. i wonder if they aired an accompanying music video on tv ya i agree i bet it was nowhere near as good as nwa's straight outta compton do you watch anything lately on tv well i always watch south park and i have seen stranger things and game of thrones what about you i also enjoy south park. i recently went back to see the 70's show and part of the simpsons ya i want to watch that one episode of the simpsons you know where bart doesnt appear at all not really but i am sure you could look it up. i personally like the episode with the 3 eyed fish oh ya i remember that blinky was his name did you ever watch pokemon yes i used to watch it on kids wb. i wonder how many episodes they have now. it is still continuing oh its probably like 800 i would never be able to catch up and thus catch em all haha i think they actually passed 1000 a while ago. in any case it is one show that would be hard to binge watch in one sitting oh for sure did you ever watch that 70s show i binged some of that the other day i do enjoy it. it is too bad the uk remake was canceled so early yup cancelled after only 10 episodes thats embarrassing. in any case i had a wonderful chat and i hope you see that simpson's episode devoid of bart. i think homer would lose his meaning in life in that episode. do you follow football at all these days hello there i do like to follow football my team didn't make the playoffs this year so that was sad. how about you i'm very sorry to hear this. i'm a huge new england patriots fan and we won the super bowl this year. nice. yeah you guys have been dominating for a while now it has been impressive. i was very surprised too be honest there was a time where i didn't think we will make the playoffs because we kept loosing our away games. yeah and as long as you make it you have a chance. speaking of football did you know that snoop dogg once wrote a fight song for his own son's school team no i didn't know this but i was really impressed with deshaun watson this year. he beat the dallas cowboys in overtime back in october by racking up 415 yards. that's impressive... that is really impressive. he was just 23 years old as well wow. yeah.. he kinda reminds me of aaron rodgers because he scrambles a lot with the intention of buying time to find the open receiver down field. now that is a great quarterback. yeah he is a bit like him. aaron rodgers has been the quarterback of my team since he came into the league actually. you're a packers fan. i love the packers and i always rooting for them when they are not playing the patriots. yeah well when we had old brett at the helm his best moment was agains your pats so that's good memories. i have to hold on to those because we have sucked the last two years lol. i think your team will be great next season because healthy rodgers is always a fantastic rodgers in my opinion. thanks i sure hope so speaking of qb's do you know who the only one to ever throw a td to himself was i think it was alex smith if i'm not mistaking. nope but that was a good guess. it was brad johnson who won a superbowl himself. wow i didn't know this. i heard somewhere that the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars. i think i have heard that too funny. i guess it just shows how big the nfl has gotten since then. yes. the nfl is huge these days and the fans are very passionate about their teams. yeah they sure are even at the high school level. did you know that there is a high school stadium in texas that seats 18000. no. i didn't know this. very interesting. yeah very interesting i guess it cost $60 million to build that sounds nuts to me. wow that is a lot of money. yeah that sure is for a high school stadium. well it's been good talking with you hope you have a good night. man that deshaun watson can run. reminds me of michael vick. he is with the dallas cowboys isn't he houston. but the dallas guy can run too.they are both dangerous out side the pocket as jay gruden has said but i wonder if this can last in the long run.given the injury risk. is watson a quarterback yeah. they had a losing record but are 9 6 under watson do you like tom brady yeah but brady cant run.plus the patriots are great.one guy never fumbled you are talking about green ellis correct yeah.thats his name. they are so good someone should paint their locker room pink to even things out. apparently the university iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink. yeah.thats what i was thinking of. smart move. alex smith smart. he took a lot of ap classes in high school. he got his bachelor's degree in two years. wow. he can run too. maybe not home run ability running that puts defenses in an awkward spot but its a weapon. you know a lot about football. thats. i read about it a lot. i like reading exercises the mind that's good. apparently espn won an emmy. for their yellow line thingie yes. i cannot imagine watching football games without seeing the superimposed yellow line. does the university of iowa use a pink one i don't think so. they painted visiting teams' locker room pink. yeah.i was just goofing on them. well i gotta run like vick soon. are you as fast as michael vick anyway it was nice chatting with you. bye. same here. do you watch the nfl i do. do you like brady yes i do. did you know he was a backup qb in high school yes and they never started him too weird yes they lost a lot of talent there and a chance to win a game yeah. .do you now who alex smith is yes he is the qb that wrapped up college in two years yes he took lots of ap tests so really planned ahead yeah. do you know who invented the circular huddle yes that was paul hubbard and he was deaf. do you know why he invented it yes because he sis not want the other team to read his gestures so smart. baker mayfield once thought of quitting football do you know why yes he wanted to become a competitive gamer yeah. u of iowan painted the visitor locker room pink. yes i wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on them i wonder too. do you know what he highest score in college football is that was 222 0 with georgia tech beating cumberland yeah. bowlers make more money in the 60s than football players yes it was not that popular of a sport back in the day yesh. did you know espn won an emmy once yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line yeah it has made watching games easier. it was really nice chatting with you today. hi how are you doing this evening good just been doing some reading for fun. i typically read novels which when they spread in the 18th century caused a moral panic people get so concerned about anything that's popular. like video games. have they destroyed america's youth hm. sometimes i wonder the same thing but i know there are games that require a lot of reading. i know some people who have even learned some foreign language from video games. i suspect that anne jones doesn't hold the record for speed reading from playing games though no she wouldn't. i wonder how long it took her to achieve that reading rate. and how much she retains. i'm not sure but 4700 words a minute is impressive. i'm glad reading hasn't become outdated though. us military branches have reading lists and starship troopers is on three of the five lists the first of sci fi to make it heinlein was in the military and i guess his books help get the troops interested in strategy and stuff. there's a lot that can be learned form books. many including the marines have ender's game as suggested reading anything to get the troops reading for fun. i think they have downtime and they want people to keep their minds active. no moral panic in the military because of sf novels. and it's beneficial. not only does it teach strategy but it also promotes critical analysis and creativity that's very true. better than just sitting around watching football on tv. i do enjoy football on occasion though. i wouldn't be able to keep up with the game as well if it weren't for the superimposed line for the first down invented by espn that line seems so obvious now. i still don't know about winning an award for it. we're so used to it now and no one thought to do it so now they have an emmy for it i'm a bit surprised that bowlers made so much money in the 60s. i guess more people knew the sports and there were sponsors or something. that's possible. plus television wasn't very popular then and it's hard to watch a football game without all the camera angles. still i wonder if it would have been entertaining or boring to watch the 1916 georgia tech game against cumberland. 220 is a lot of touchdowns. i hope that the gt team used their third string. that score seems punitive. plus i wonder who bet on the game. i wonder who their qb was. or maybe their rb was as talented as green ellis who went through his nfl career without a fumble cumberland probably fumbled on every play. well i enjoyed chatting. that seems likely. yikes. have a good night. you too. back to reading i was sorry to hear in the news recently that c. payne lucas has passed away. yea bit she was 85 and had a pretty productive life he had a life to be proud of doing a lot of great work providing aid to people all across africa. yea he founded africare in 1971. it's amazing that he did so much after not only getting a college degree but also taking a break from his studies to serve in the military. yea pretty amazing for a guy that started out picking cotton and shinning shoes. maybe the way he worked so hard to rise in life was the inspiration for him trying to help others do the same. yea and had to be a long life to outlive his sin who died in 2013 and his daughter who dies in 2017. it's sad to think he would have to see his children pass away but i hope he got to enjoy time with his two grandchildren. yea i hope so as well. i know off topic but dis you know jfk washington and jefferson were our richest presidents. that makes sense since washington and jefferson were landowners and jfk was from a wealthy family. i'm surprised no recent presidents are on the list though. maybe they should release a pop album like the president of indonesia. i think if the current president did that it would either bomb terribly or become a chart topper. my luck people would like it and every time i turned in the radio i would have to have to hear him. maybe the entire government should start releasing debate opinions in songs. congressional rap battle supreme court opera lol i can see bernie now first album free healthcare foos and the mitch mcconnell retort the capitalism rap. lol. they could have their music studios in nevada since the government owns 86% of the land there. people might actually start tuning in to the government debates on tv. republicans vs democrats rap battle. they'd all start wearing gold chains like rappers and we'd actually see where the taxes go. hey. how are you doing i find it funny that the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana. hi. that is funny. i wonder if banana has a different meaning in their language. say did you know that fdr was the last of our presidents that can speak a foreign language it might. or it could actually be his last name. i didn't know that about fdr. i did learn that the top 3 wealthiest presidents are jfk washington and jefferson. washington and jefferson are two of the wealthiest i guess i can see jefferson but i thought washington was a general. i thought so too. maybe he became wealthy as a president i wonder if the president of indonesia is wealthy they released 3 pop albums while in office. you know he just might be. that could be the whole reason he did it to make money. our presidents have been rich but not smart. the last one to have a phd was woodrow wilson. interesting. and unfortunately i do agree with you. and not very philanthropic. the norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the amazon rain forest. i couldn't see our own gov't do that. no i can't see them doing that either. they'd be more like the chinese government who censored the word censorship. haha very true. did you know that a french man impersonated a government official and managed to sell the eiffel tower twice. no i didn't. he did that twice. once is bad enough. i can't believe he got away with it again. yes twice. amazing. and speaking of bans wikileaks published the gov't's plan to destroy wikileaks. makes me feel like they have a lot to hide. they probably do. on the flip side they do publish full names of anyone that chooses to renounce their citizenship. that's interesting. sounds like they are trying to create a witch hunt against people who seem unpatriotic. in 2006 the us passed legislation that would protect gov't employees from being persecuted for violating geneva conventions. nice way to protect themselves if you ask me. they get protected a lot. back in 1895 j.p. morgan bailed the government out. i agree. off topic have you ever watched the simpsons i've watched a few shows. it seems like it's been on a long time. a very long time. there is only 1 episode where bart is never mentioned or appears. just one he's obviously very important to the show. hasn't homer had a lot of jobs i think i read somewhere that he's had over a hundred. haha really i didn't know that. i thought he always worked at the nuclear plant. yeah if i remember right it was all in the first 400 jobs that he had the different jobs. really. that's funny. well great chat. do you watch any television i do enjoy watching television. what about you i love my tv shows. i like south park you ever watch that south park always annoyed me. i have watched quite a bit of pokemon though. for sure when south park made fun of family guy the simpsons sent them flowers. i like pokemon too i have kids so i watch a lot of cartoons mostly on pbs like wild kratts and thomas the tank. nice they ever watch some of the 750 episodes of pokemon. i love thomas the tank also. i like the ones narrated by alec baldwin the best. he just has one of those voices made for narration. nice i liked those a lot. mine was ringo starr ones he has that thomas the tank type voice that's true. very gravelly and engine like. it is crazy how far tvs have come even in just a few short years though. i remember watching cartoons in black and white. dang i remember saturday morning cartoons. did you ever watch that 70s show yes. that show was hilarious. too bad the sequels and spinoffs tanked so terribly. right i heard the one in uk only lasted 10 episodes and that 80s show was a bust too. i think the uk one probably wasn't as popular because it was a very american humor show not really the british dry wit. for sure there is two different kinds of comedy right there. it is just like the office in british vs american i think the british office was on for ages longer than the american one. i never really got that one. designated survivor is a good one though. never heard of that one what is that about it is about a man who becomes president after the capitol is blown up. i will have to check that out. speaking of capitol hill are you a trump fan i respect the office and what his intentions were but i'm not a fan of how he is going about it. what about you that is a great way to put it. i think if he released an album like the president of indonesia did he would be more popular lol i dont' think the us would handle it well if he did that. he is already controversial. that might push his advesaries over the edge. i like watching the nfl football is the best of the 4 major professional sports. i agree. it's much more interesting than basketball or baseball. when i was young i wanted to play in the nfl. being female i was a bit small even though technically it would have been allowed. there have been a few female kickers but i don't think any have made it past college football. hopefully some day yes the kickers play the least of all even though there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in a whole game. that's why i can't sit and watch a whole game. i have to be doing something else at the same time. too many breaks and replays. i know a lot people like it but it gets to be too much sometimes. yes. but if you like technology you can learn a lot they have tracking chips in the shoulder pads and the ball to study that would be interesting to look into. i may have to now. yes. the game is so dangerous that even though they get paid a lot an engineer will make more money over a career. it is surely a short lived career. but many go into coaching of some sort after. yes. my dog and i still enjoy watching the game. she understands when i yell and point at the screen ha. that's cute. she must think people are stealing a toy. which i guess they are. yes my dog is loveable she has even donated blood she has a rarer type of the 12 different types dogs have. oh thats really amazing. i didn't know dogs could donate blood. yes they can. other dogs need it after surgeries as well. i like how istanbul treats their animals it even has vending machine for stray dogs there are some dog parks here in america that are starting to do it too. but i have heard many areas in turkey treat stray cats and dogs wonderfully. they are part of their community. yes i love dogs and cats. google likes dogs better though its even in their code of conduct. i love almost all animals. they're pretty amazing. me too. my cat gets a bit testy sometimes though. many people think that dogs are color blind but they are not they just dont see as many colors as humans. it would be hard to train them as service animals if they couldn't see any colors. yes they are very useful in so many ways. hello do you like football i do its actually one of my favorite sports do you like it i dont follow it much but i do watch it sometimes. do you have a favorite team mine is in the afc division the 49ers but they havent been good in awhile. my favorite team is the patriots and maybe this season the 49ers can make it to the superbowl yeah that would be cool lol george rr martin calls the patriots the lannisters of football lol thats a funny reference lol but i guess it makes sense they have dominated the league for a while now great coach + great players + awesome qb do you watch any tv shows i do i like to watch the simpsons what about you yeah classic. i love the simpsons. funny how homer had 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes not a guy i would trust with the safety of a nuclear power plant yeah lol did you know there is one episode that bart is not seen or mentioned. i didnt know that he is like the star of the show doesnt make sense to have simpsons without bart. i know right. what other shows do you like to watch game of thrones westworld handmaids tale homeland broklyn nine nine the flash supergirl walking dead santa clarita diet how i met your mother sounds like you follow a lot of tv shows lol i like got and also the flash there are a lot of good series on tv now yeah i watch a lot of tv. im still catching up on the flash i think i am on season 4 right now. yes i agree too much good tv. in between shows i like to watch discovery channel shows lol season 4 is one of the best ones i like how reverse flash is back on the show and cicada is a formidable villain would you be much of a football fan or interested in the eagles yes i am a football fan like the eagles and wished they have made it to the superbowl. i can't say that i am. i'm aware of the big stuff that goes on but not the details. i certainly wouldn't get worked up about who the eagles play first in a season. i am not a eagles fan either i am a steelers but since the steelers haven't made it i turned to the eagles. i live near cleveland i know the browns and steelers are rivals. i think the only team the browns fans dislike more are the ravens as they feel like they stole their team. i have never care for the ravens for some reason so are you a browns fan i live here so i guess by default i am. i'm not born and raised so it's not life or death for me. is there anything harder in football than being a browns fan well i would say no especially if you are a fan win or lose because for some reason they seems not to be able to make it to a superbowl these days. do you watch much football on television monday night football and all that no i watched sunday's game also my current home is las vegas and i pretty much live in the casino watching sports i try to watch the majority of the games including college football. that sounds like a lot of work. i think part of the reason i haven't got into football is the length of the game i just don't have three hours. i doesn't help that i was born in britain. oh so do you have a favorite sport that you spend time watching on your days off from work or just for your relaxed and run time i have a young family all my free time seems to have vanished. back in the day is would have been soccer. i barely see any tv anymore the kids hog the remote now. hahaha i understand did you know the nfl uses tracking chips in their shoulder pads to record players movements on the field do you use that information when your in the casino to give you an edge how many games a week do you think you watch i only get weekends at the casino i always get my weekends off from work now it just my wife and i no i don't used it. you don't have a dog by chance i have full house here kids dogs rabbits and my wife has a horse. maybe i should buy myself a ticket to las vegas for some peace. yes at least for a vacation the chips are also located in the football to track velocity rotation ball speed and location. it's amazing the amount of information they collect in sports now. when i read reports about soccer they tell you how far the player has ran sprinted pass percentages and such. they have heat maps to to show where they've been on the field too. i watched soccer also i don't completely understand the entire rules and game i do understand how the players score points. well good luck in the casino and have a good day. hello how are you do you like dogs i love dogs you know who else likes dogs google. yes i read that too. i didn't know that they had blood drives though did you i didn't. that is helpful because i think dogs have 12 different blood types yes interesting. its good to know dogs are not color blind. i wonder which colors they see most for sure. we were taught wrong growing up yes i thought it was black and white growing up. i agree lol. did you know dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing yes isn't that interesting as well. i wish we had those vending machines here in the us with food and water for dogs in exchange for plastic bottles. that's such a good idea.. for sure i would be donating left and right. i love dogs. do you watch tv some not as much as i use to. when i have time i'm on the internet where i can look up shows i like. i do have cable but i rarely use it. yea me too. i was a fan of pokemon back in the day. they have 750 episodes yes it was always on it seems. do you remember thomas the tank engine i used to love that show did you watch it no i wasn't sure what it was was it a children show yes it was a book too. thomas the train was like blue and gray. i think there were famous people who played his voice here and there yes ringo star was one of them. do you watch football the nfl's average live game play is only 11 minutes. that is insane. that means like everything else is almost 3 hours. talk about boring if you think about it. they need a woman to play yes there is no rule against it. good chat.. you too have a good night. you too. what do you think about malcolm perry do you think he has a good future in the navy i'm not sure who he is is he a football player yes he is a quarterback for the navy football team apparently. and he's really good i think better than baker mayfield was during his u of ok days yes that's possible. at least he's better than baker mayfield was at halo 3 and the baker was excellent at halo 3 haha. yeah he thought about becoming a pro gamer. i'm from cleveland so i'm glad he didn't follow through with that. yep i agree with you. what do you think about kelly moore by the way he's the only quarterback in the nfl who is left handed which is crazy i think that's awesome. of course i would as i'm a lefty too. i still find it odd that espn won an emmy for their superimposed yellow line. that is so weird. that is really weird. but it is a great invention. what do you think about the highest scoring football game of all time by the way i don't know anything about it was it georgia tech my brother goes there. yes georgia tech won they beat cumberland 222 to 0 definitely a blowout. that's insane. i wonder why the coaches didn't stop it then again the u of ia has a locker room painted pink for their visiting team. yes i wonder how that turned out for them. do you think they won more games after it was painted pink i want to see the stats on that i would like to see those too. these days pink is considered ambiance lol. in the 60's pro bowlers made more than football players. that's unreal. that is crazy definitely it's the opposite case today. do you ever watch basketball by the way i know that kareem abdul jabbar was super awesome back in the day i watch the cavs lol. i find it funny that there is a court in the supreme court building and they actually call it the highest court in the land. that is really funny. you think they ever play up there it's funny because it's on the top floor too i wonder that myself. i bet some of them do. what do you think of the new zealand basket ball team well i think their nickname is not a good one for the united states lol they call themselves the all blacks nope that isn't racist at all. what are some of these people thinking i find it odd that the man who invented basketball is the only losing coach in the u of ks history. that is really funny. james naismith definitely should have practiced more and maybe change the game so that he could win lol the navy's player malcolm perry is looking good. he cant stop moving those feet of his. right he definitely seems ready for the new season to show what he's got yeah i love watching the navy football team and think their qb perry is the best up and coming player because of his speed. hecan zip around and beat guys that way. i agree. also think he's ready to show he can throw this year too. he's been working on his passes and has a good arm. yeah i agree. he can throw bullets with great accuracy too. perry has the southern methodist game haunting him and has something to prove now. i don't blame him. he rushed 282 yards which was a record but his only pass was intercepted. definitely impacted his confidence in what he could do and his abilities. you make a really good point that i forgot to credit him. the offensive coordinator ivan jasper has been working with perry on throwing and new reps. they feel really confident about perry's skills as a thrower. though it's been a few years since perry focused on passing he was a quarterback in high school. yeah i agree with you. coach jasper has also been working with perry on rapid fire passing drills and throwing one on one with him since spring practice. that is promising and super cool too. i agree. i think jasper is in a better more focused place to work with perry too. he's been more focused and in a better place to be able to work with perry since his son's heart transplant surgery. i can't even imagine going through something so scary and serious with any of my kids. perry has a good handle of his career and his personal life and knows how to focus on what's important and be in the moment. alex smith is another amazing qb. perry seems more mature and comfortable in the football world too. it seems like he understands things better and is in a position to answer questions and talk in football speak. yeah he might be the next alex smith or baker mayfield who knows because both of those quarterbacks are very accomplished. alex smith went to college early. he took so many classes in high school that he went super early. really that's impressive. i did not know that about alex smith. random fact though did you know there's only one left handed quarterback in the nfl noway i have never really thought about it but that is very rare. yeah alex smith was actually getting his bachelors within the first two years of college. he is a very smart guy on and off the field. wow that's really cool. sounds a lot like that senior abey. started 9 games last year for a 7 6 team. man thats crazyreally i went to kansas and james naismith was the inventor of the basketball that's the closest i have been to a famous college story. well that's super cool. another random fact which surprised me the other day only 2 african american quarterbacks have won the super bowl. noway that doesn't seem right but it is a fact for sure. the highest paid state employees are coaches now thats not surprising. i did not know that about coaches though i guess it makes sense. i do know that the american flags at football stadiums weigh 1100 pounds and cost $50000 to make which seems like a lot of money. that is really incredible. a lot of money flows through sports and keeps players engaged. baker mayfield almost became a professional gamer instead of qb. it was a good thing that he wised up for all our sakes. the money is in football. or in basketball movies like space jam. which is the highest grossing basketball movie of all time. good flicks i need to rewatch them this weekend. have a good one. how's it going did you know tom brady's jv team never started him despite not winning a game that's incredible. i guess that's why the coach is a jv coach. he was a pretty awful jv coach if he couldn't even get his team to score a touchdown did you know football can mean different sports depending on what region you are in yea it can be called soccer or rugby in certain places also australian rules and gaelic. did you know that in 39 of 50 states the highest paid public employee are either college football or basketball coaches no that's a shame states waste that much money on football/basketball coaches i mean the supreme court has a basketball court on its top floor. sports are a part of our lives now that's pretty funny theres a court at the supreme court considering most of the judges are very old who are some of your favorite quarterbacks in the nfl alex smith is pretty cool he was able to start college as a junior i heard about that. and he still ended up being the first overall pick in the nfl draft. i wonder if alex smith was able to finish his masters degree after he was drafted probably. baker mayfield definitely didn't get his masters after getting drafted. i heard he's a hardcore gamer yea he's a good qb but doesn't seem too smart if he seriously consider playing video games professionally gaming is very popular nowadays though. if you can make money off of it hats off to you. yea but he could always do that after retirement instead of broadcasting like kellan moore does now after being the only left handed qb in the nfl i feel bad for those college players that don't have a shot at the nfl. there's a qb at navy that didn't attempt a pass for his final three starts that's a shame who was he his name's malcolm perry. he's a junior. you gotta be tough to start at qb for navy yea well it was nice chatting with you hi. are you a fan of sports i love watching football and basketball but not so much tom brady. i find it funny his high school team never even allowed him to play. lol. i think most of america agrees with you. he has more super bowl wins than most teams. for sure. i always found it curious that the whole point of the huddle was to help a deaf quarterback communicate without the opposing team seeing his signals. i know how cool to have something you did to help you out stick and be a big part of the game. maybe if that team who lost by 222 points used it they might have done better. no doubt. or they could have used alex jones he was smart enough he took so many ap tests in high school that he started college as a junior and then became the number one draft pick. that is certainly a lot of classes he even worked to a masters degree while staying to play. yes. he is amazing. its funny in baseball being left handed can be an asset but there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl. that is certainly surprising i wonder why more left handed people don't play the position i don't know. maybe they prefer bowling bowlers used to make twice as much as football players. it seems like doing anything in sports will get you some notoriety like espn winning an emmy for the yellow line. clearly i chose the wrong line of work for sure. you could take up basketball even the supreme court likes to play. yup. highest court in the land ) it is odd though that the inventor of the sport went on to be the only losing coach at the u of kansas. that is pretty crazy. i think i want to be a coach though in 39 states a coach is the highest paid state employee. there definitely is a lot of money in sports even if you arent like green ellis and never have a fumble. yeah that is pretty insane. or you could be like kareem adbul jabbar who was so good at dunking that he got the shot banned. some people getting so good they are ruining it for the rest of us. ha ha i am only 5'1 so dunking has never been my forte even though there has been some good short players. im not much taller only 5'6 jumping really hasnt been my strong suit. so a career in basketball was never in my cards seeing as i am not a strong free thrower even if it is granny style. granny style is the actual most consistent way to shoot but no one ever wants to do that. the hoop is 10 feet high so that's almost twice my height. much easier for the 7 footers well i must get going it has been nice chatting today don't hit new zealand you won't be tall enough for their team. do you like the nfl i am. i'm a big fan of sports and sports trivia in general. great sounds like we will get along i am a fan of sports as well do you have a favorite team definitely not the saints. they have a pretty sexist policy i'm not a fan of regarding the cheerleaders and players. that rule is so unfair makes me angry its really humiliating yeah can you believe they can't even eat in the same restaurant not only that but if a player comes into the restaurant while a cheerleader is already mid meal the cheerleader has to leave. terrible rule i would be so angry and feel so bad if i had to leave specially if im with friends and family humiliating and really unfair oddly enough though did you know the league itself has no written rule saying women can't play i don't think that will ever happen watching a woman play in the nfl apparently as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements they can play. i bet woman could be as capable as men in the game if they had the same strength sounds like the increase of females in engineering will be worth it over a career in football anyhow as the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of a football player. oh i see and i do agree sexism can be another issue amazing how much money engineers make it's pretty crazy how much football players make though considering the average game only has an average of 11 minutes of actual gameplay. only 11 minutes what a scam the game lasts 60 minutes and only 11 minutes accounts to less than a quarter a televised game lasts even longer than an hour in my experience. i suppose we could use the tracking chips in the players' pads and the balls to find out how they really spend most of their time. that is a great idea that way we can tell the distance they actually run the calories and many different stats about the game cool facts and stats more specifically they use the tracking devices to track velocity rotation ball speed and location. do you like basketball as well i like it less than football but i think it's funny that the us supreme court building has a basketball court on top of the building called the highest court in the land. that is a great name for a court must be really nice to play or watch a game there judges must play tournamets all the time hey. eli manning just had a birthday earlier this month. he turned 38 and my guess is has more cash than everyone i know will ever see. (.) i know. and he was not even the best manning. lol. i don't really know too much about football and what i do know is a direct result of my husband and sons being die hard steelers fans. aside from food i have no dog in the fight haha. i do know iowa's visitors locker room is all pink and i also know the oregon duck's have an amazing stadium. you're like my wife but she hates the food i cook because it is usually fatty and not good for you… i self identify as a fat woman when in reality i'm 100 lbs soaking wet chili beer wings nachos and some spinach dip are what i'm doing this sunday for the super bowl. definitely not healthy but tastey so i'm down for that. damn. that sounds great. im going to make sume jubalaya. i may add some wings now. although it is supposed to be 40 this week so i may not be able to grill. that's tragic. i wonder if eli manning's name is spelled elisha rather than elijah or if that is a typo. for a man who has a genuis level iq i'd suspect he'd be po'ed at his parents for such an unusual spelling of that name when you have 2 super bowl rings and your dad has none you can be a little mean to him. i suppose so. we're winners and we can do what we want. wait. that was nascar and talladega nights not nfl. i find it hysterical someone was quoted as saying competitors last in this league speaking of the nfl. i thought nfl stood for not for long. maybe he can paint his room pink like the university of iowa painted their visitor's locker room. lol lol lol how much do pro bowlers make today if they made more in the 60's than pro football players surely it's more than i'm making now. i'm more into being lazy and i need/want a new job. maybe i can take up bowling. have you ever seen king pin with woody harrelson. everytime i see bowling on tv i think to myself i'm in awe to be around so many great athletes. and giggle. gosh yes i forgot all about that flick. should rewatch that. maybe you could be a movie critic as your new gig. just watch netflix all day. i'm not flamboyant enough to be a movie critic but bowling and drinking beer is something i would certainly give an honest effort haha. that's the spirit. i wouldn't be sober enough to practice or compete. drinking beer at the bowling alley is almost pavlovian. if uncle buck could do it so could you and i. one rule no toothpicks allowed haha ha. it's like playing darts. you just have a beer while doing it. did you see the youtube vid where the guy who built the exploding glitter bomb package had also built a dartboard that moves for a bullseye every time i would need one of those to be successful in darts. otherwise everyone nearby would need a helmet and pads lol ha. i did see the exploding glitter bomb. if he sold it on amazon he could make a killing. people like me are so vindictive. i am as well. i use the heck out of amazon prime now and instacart. i can't even tell you the last time i was even in an actual grocery store or mall. and would be as mad as a baptized cat if someone swiped my stuff off my porch. i know. i am glad i live in the woods with security cameras. nice chatting with you. hi there would you happen to be a football fan i'm a big nfl fan. cool. are you a fan of eli manning i am. i hope he keeps playing. his first name is elisha. different name i've never heard before. i had no idea. crazy to think peyton and their father were all good (for a time.) qbs yes. i remember when their dad archie played because i was a kid then and he was a qb during those years. eli has a genius level iq. i wonder what it takes to be a genuis lol i wish i knew the secret. lol eli played college at the university of mississippi and was originally drafted by the san diego chargers who immediately traded him to the ny giants. yea i don't think he wanted to play there. i see the nfl has no rule against female players. interesting. wonder if one will ever play. maybe a kicker the saints have an odd rule that prevents females from eating at a restaurant at the same time as an nfl player. odd rule. i could see a woman kicker player in the nfl. an average game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay. crazy when you think that the games stretch out to over 3 hours. lol the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that the earnings of an average nfl or mlb player. yea shorter careers for sure. i believe they offer financial counseling too interesting. they need it. i read somewhere that nfl players are broke too years after retiring from the game. did you know they put tracking chips in the shoulder pads and footballs to record data i figured they had to know about speed and velocity somehow. i wonder if they are really small they would have to be i would think do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was i don't know from before the super bowl era oh yeah.in 1916. lol georgia tech beat cumberland 222 0. well i could call that a blowout. defintately. lol in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars during that time. times have sure changed since then. definitely i do not appreciate the redskins effort against the giants . it got worse which teams do you expect to win the superbowl i think any team could win that since it is a game of the champions the redskins certainly will not win it seems. no they will not. they know that themselves. that is the result of their self critiques in the visitors locker room at metlife stadium will the giants make it of course everyone knows that giant has always been a team with good forward and they sliced on redskin defense the nfl actually has 32 teams/ each year some of them are not competitive though. yes and the giants had always seem to stand out in them. they have most of their rushing total in dec. 21 2008. when they won carolina apparently the university of iowa features pink locker rooms. i am not sure what you mean by that. but i will like to chip in this fact that football recorded the highest score ever in 1916 that's so long ago. apparently this game featured georgia tech. of course yes it ended in a 222 0. wow that is so huge i have never seen such a blowout. benjarvus green ellis has never fumbled. yes i learnt that but i don't know if he make that much because it is a known fact that the top player from 1960 made twice as much as top football stars espn came out with the yellow line on the televised field. that is cool it helped a lot. do you know of a new york giants player called eli. the short form for elisha bowlers used to get paid more than football stars. yes i know that but do you pay attention to eli he was the overall pick for 2004 nfl draft he has been a decent nfl qb born in 1981. i have a cousin that was his great fan because of his genius level iq his full name is elisha. do you follow the nfl what do you think about their loss to the giants i do watch the nfl. the nfc east is really competitive. it could have gone either way. they gave up 200 yards and missed too many tackles. they just didn't continue the momentum they had. they missed out on a 3 game winning streak to finish the season. i do not like them so im kinda glad. that's too bad. do you know there is no rule against female players. i did not. i think it would be scary to watch women play against some of the larger football players. surprisingly though new orleans saints cheerleaders have to leave a diner if they see another nfl player in the restaurant. unfair standards. seems sexist. maybe that's why they lost 2 weeks ago on a bad call. karma. i'm glad for the yellow line though from espn. it helps a lot on calls in football. they won an award emmy for it. when it first came out i told my wife that people had to move it and that players have tripped on it. im a bad person. i wish i was at the game where 222 points was scored in football back in 1916. that would have been a trip at georgia tech. you gotta pull the qb at 60 0 right speaking of emasculating iowa paints their visiting locker room pink. sounds like another intimidation factor. bowlers made more than top football stars in the 60's. that's crazy. that's odd. they don't make more than elisha manning. how much does elisha make millions. he's the qb for the ny giants football team. his brother also plays and his dad played. i feel bad for his older brother cooper. he never played. seems like he's the odd man out. eli manning and peyton both were number one drafts yes they were. i wonder where archie was drafted i'm not sure but manning played for university of mississippi 2000 to 2003 and was first pick for san diego but immediately traded to the giants. lucky for the giants. nice chatting with you. hey there my friend you ever watch football on television i do not follow football but i do watch it occassionally. i watch the super bowl. i don't normally watch a lot of sports though. do you like the patriots they have a player that has never fumbled the ball before. his name is benjarvus green ellis no i do not like the patriots. i think that is a former player though yes that is impressive i wonder why this guy isnt more known yes i agree with you. like i said i don't really watch sports so i'm not sure if he's a current player or not haha. what i do know is that espn won an emmy. they created that yellow line that shows the first downs on football games good for them. i hear the highest score in football was 222 0. that is crazy. i know right. i can't believe that georgia tech was that much better. i would have left the stands once it got to 100 to 0 lol i know right lol me too. what are your thoughts on eli manning i know that he was super dominant back when he played. i know eli is short for elisha. that is really weird. also i didn't know he was born in 1981. i've never heard the name elicia before. also apparently he has a genius level iq thats amazing. is he related to taryn manning shes from orange is the new black. oh i didn't know that. i've never seen that show so i have no idea. i guess he is the son of nfl quarterback archie manning in the younger brother of nfl quarterback peyton manning. it's definitely in their blood to be good quarterbacks haha i dont know if he is related to her i was just asking. yeah thats interesting. i guess they just have that natural talent. did you know that the nfl uses tracking chips in the shoulder pads they can track the location and position of all the players as well as the ball thats that is really cool they also put it in the football. yep you're right. they can tell the ball speed location rotation and velocity i just hope that they stopped the tracking after the players leave the field haha that would be super awkward its in their shoulder pads so i guess it depends where they take those lol haha yep well as long as they don't take anywhere those home lol. what do you think of the fact that the nfl game on average only has about 11 minutes of gameplay that seems solo to me yeah that crazy too many time outs breaks commercials yep it gets annoying after a while. i wonder if we will ever have a female player do you think that we will there's no rule against it apparently hi how are you hello im great im happy because my favorite team won the superbowl on the weekend. so happy indeed. you're a pats fan congrats on the win. i am a patriots fan and thanks a lot what team do you like afc or nfc i like the bears so nfc north. i was rooting for the pats though. what did you do to celebrate how did the bears do this season do you know if they are getting new players this season and i was with friends and family i drank a lot of beer and got wasted lol they made the playoffs but lost on a missed kick to philly. we're not getting anyone. we're ok and will add a few pieces. at least our locker room isn't pink. its better to mantain a solid base sounds like you were close and yeah i wonder what is the effect of those pink locker rooms on visiting teams not as bad as a 222 0 whoopin' georgia tech put on cumberland. that must be the most humilliating loss in football history i would have retire from football after that game if you lose by more than 200 points and didnt score then something is seriously wrong. i think it should be forced retirement if you lose by more than 200. you should never wear a uniform again. as i was writing that i thought where is cumberland anyways so they may have been forced into retirement. i dont think they have a football team anymore lol they were in need of a player like benjarvus green ellis. or maybe they didn't have the yellow line and didn't know where the first down was could be i guess we have espn to thank for that now it was a great contribution although not sure if it deserved an emmy. an emmy is pretty far. but can you imagine watching without it now yeah i agree it did change things for football do you know who eli manning is i do. he's payton's little brother right what's he do for a living he is the quarterback of the giants i guess football runs in the family i would say so. isn't his dad a famous football player too yup he played for around 13 seasons and was a pretty good player as well elis first name is actually elisha i think someone wanted a girl lol i would say so. i think eli was a good choice but it is hard to pick on an elisha when he can throw a ball through your chest. i agree lol probably wouldnt want to mess with him you know eli actually has a high iq like at a genius level. do you follow the nfl i don't really watch it much how about you i do i love the sport so the nfl has 2 divisions nfc and afc interesting so the national football conference and the american football conference. and they play against each other it seems. well 16 teams in each division the play against each other and then they face the champion of the other conference in the super bowl so its afc vs nfc in the end. that sounds pretty interesting. apparently the nfl has no written rules about females joining. really so females could also play that is a bit unusual i don't think i have the stomach to watch that. yeah but they would have to be pretty strong to meet the requirements i imagine. i wonder if there have been any females in the nfl i don't think so i haven't seen one at least. interesting how players have tracking chips in their shoulders yeah that is a bit strange. also very interesting how there's only actually 11 minutes of game play. only 11 minutes woah thats not much at all games last 2 3 hours yeah there is so much that goes into it with such little actual game play. new orleans saints cheerleaders and players are not allowed to dine together. very strange. that is strange i don't like that rule i hear that cheerleaders have to leave if a player arrives at a restaurant so unfair. yeah i wonder why it was made up or if it's even enforced. the university of iowas visiting locker room is painted pink. that's funny that would confuse a team or two lol being all pumped up in a pink locker room that is funny. i think i read once that pink it a calming color they use it in some jails too. the highest score in a football game was 222 0. ouch. 222 0 woah.. that is a humiliating defeat the other team was blind or thought they were scoring in the wrong direction. yeah i can't imagine what was going on to lose that bad. the top bowlers in the 1960s made more than the top football stars. times have definitely changed. they made more money really i guess that score makes more sense now did you hear about the emmy espn won back in the day i haven't heard about that how did they manage that they won the emmy because of the creation of the yellow first down line anyway its been great chatting with you. interesting. nice chatting with you too. yeah a lot of cool facts and thanks for that i feel a lot smarter have an nice night. good morning. how are you today hi how are you i'm good i'm doing well. are you a fan of football at all i sometimes watch. i try to watch the super bowl. this year it was so boring. it was even more boring to know that only 11 minutes of live gameplay happened in it haha. i think the game was better the previous year. a big comeback at the end. 11 minutes yeah it seems too short. but there is so much violence people love it. oh i agree. i bet it was a better game than in 1916 where cumberland lost to georgia tech 222 0 lol. i wonder what the coach was thinking there. i think that a game like that is shameful. what is the point i feel like the team just gave up from the beginning. maybe they had a pink locker room like the iowa hawkeye's visitor locker room is. that pink locker room stunt. does that work at all does u of iowa win a lot at home i doubt it. i don't think it works. i'm a hawkeye fan and they seem to win more on the road haha. if it worked other teams would do the same thing. still it is a fun fact. well said. can you believe the green bay packers have been around since 1919 yes i can. that is a strange name though. what exactly do they pack i'm not sure. i know they were started based off the name of indian packing company. oh that makes sense. were they a meat packing company did they own the team i think the team is owned by the city now. i know they paid for the packers first uniforms if they named the team after them. good move on their part since they've sold out every game since 1960. yeah i wonder how much it would cost to buy tix from someone. the secondary market must be expensive. i agree. i wish i would have been at the game where they first lost to the beloit fairies. that is a unique name for a football team. what a name. how would you like play for that team hello im a fairy. no seriously i am. anyway great chat. haha too funny. have a great day. do you like football i sure do. snoop dogg once wrote a song for his son's team wow. u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink wow i wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on the players i wonder too. bowlers made more than football players in the 60s yeah i guess it was a more popular sport back in the day true. do you know the highest score in college football yes it was 222 0 and that was in 1916 do you know who was playing yes it was georgia tech that made history with that win against cumberland yeah. did you know that more than half of the largest football stadiums are in the us really that is amazing. espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line yeah. did you hear nfl is using tracking chips on the players now wow cool. did you know that women can play in the nfl nice. the tracking chips are being used to collect information like velocity and rotation and such nice i wonder if they can use that to make the game safer good point. did you know matt patricia used to be a rocket scientist wow that is such a huge career jump amazing i know. do you know when the first nfl playoff game was played i actually do not know that when was it it was back in 1932 very long ago. nice chat same here how much do you know about american football nothing at all. do you know that the nfl is the american football league i do know that. the national football league right yes i was suprised to learn that they actually have no written rule about not allowing female players. if they met the requirements of the league women would be able to play. also did you know that an average game only shows 11 minutes of live gameplay i just read that. and don't the games last for 2 hours usually what are they doing in the mean time there is a lot of commentary breaks in between positioning themselves and etc. it is those few minutes the ball is thrown that makes or breaks the game. thats crazy that it all takes so long. nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. they are also located inside footballs to track velocity rotation ball speed and location.do you like football while i am not as passionate about it as some i do have a passing interest. at the end of the day they are collecting data to make better decisions to win the nfl. do you watch the what do i watch hit the wrong key. do you watch the green bay packers i recently read that they are the only community owned major franchise in american professional sports having a sold out game since 1960 and involving the community as a whole. thats awesome. the green bay packers are named after the indian packing company who paid for their first uniforms on the condition the team be named after them. wow how long a way they have come from barely having their uniforms to being a nationally recognized football team. the green bay packers have sold out every game since 1960 too. indeed they have an impressive history as the 3rd oldest franchise in the nfl. i wonder why the new orleans saints wont let their cheerleaders eat in the same resturant as the players i also wonder if there is a story behind it. what do you think may be the reason maybe they tend to get the crowd worked up the nfl has 32 teams that play. perhaps. this was a nice discussion. after we finish i am curious to look up why. me too. nice to talk to you today. hello. hello happy new years. happy new years. do you like football did you know aaron jones carried the ball 17 times for 107 yards. yes i really like soccer. what a good move this man made definitely. the green bay packers are a very good team. is that your favorite team yes they are a great team i think. i have others but they are doing so good. well i have many favorites in fact i enjoy more to see the best ones than to rival them yes. very true although prime pick success rate 5 7 green bay packers ( 1) at detroit lions pick sports commonly called football in certain places include association football (known as soccer in some countries). gridiron football (specifically american football or canadian football). australian rules football. rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union). and gaelic football. these different variations of football are known as football codes. cool. very interesting. it's crazy that the nfl consists of 32 teams. that's a lot. football is amazing yes too much. hey what do you think about field football i like it. i like all sports really. i think which type of football you like depends on the area you live in. i like them all. well maybe it's in the area. i am more fond of this type of football in general but i also enjoy other did you know the highest score of a football game was 222 0 that's crazy. back in 1916. wow that team was very mediocre. they would be playing with cones hahahaha hahaha that's true. i think it's funny that university of iowa painted the locker room pink for the visiting teams so funny. hahahaha yeah. they like to make them big rivals to provoke. although everything is part of the show very true. it's very interesting to know that bowlers.made twice as much money as football stars in the 60's.weird. hey what do you think about what the famous david beckan did in our country with the stadium i think i don't know too much about that. but we need to keep watching football for sure. it has been great chatting. have a great day. you have a good day hello good morning. football huh was interesting to see that women could be in the league if they met league eligibility. yeah me too.an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay i would be curious to actually time that during some game. i wonder why they chose to put chips in the shoulder pads they must be pretty strong to withstand the force on the field. yeah i was blow away by that. new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after the cheerleaders are required to leave. seems to me a little sexist. i wonder why only that team and not any of the others like the packers. i wonder if being community owned any money made by the team goes back to the community in some fashion or back into the team hmmmm. the green bay packers are named after the indian packing company who paid for their first uniforms on the condition the team be named after them. yes and beat by fairies.appropriate .) . some things about this sport are interesting. i couldn't imagine having gone to the georgia tech game. a 222 0 score did the other team even show up that's absolutely crazy. what a boring game to attend the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink guess they think that is going to psych out the opponent. i would think that would trigger them to play harder. guess there are just some teams that don't feel the need for gimmicks to win or draw in fans. if the packers have been able to sell out ever game since 1960 and have a wait list for tickets 30 years out wow. not a fan of rodgers but the green bay packers are the only community owned not for profit major franchise in american professional sports i live in minnesota so definitely not a fan of the pack. i am more player fan anyway. i love odell from the giants. guess he isn't going to be going anywhere but eli might be looking for a new team. i'm a die hard cowboys fan. i can't wait for this weekend. who are they playing america's team.wonder who gave them that name guess if i had to pick a team it would be da bears and khalil mack. big on defensive. think it is what really wins the games. cowboys have the seahawks at home. not sure what to expect from them. dallas defense is for real though. lawrence and the lbs are something else. seahawks are going to be touch at home. they claim their stadium has one of the best home filed advantages. out of 139 games to win 99 of them they might be right. yes they are tough at home no doubt. dallas plays at home though. the nfl is one of the four major professional sports leagues in north america i wonder if they will ever go higher than the 32 teams or are they just going to keep moving teams around. how many times can la get a team and then they move. rams raiders.they have both moved several times from there already. lol not doubt i've enjoyed this chat. one last cool fact former partiots rb benjarvus green ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career. i saw that talk about a great statistic.. do you know who he played for name isn't familiar to me. i guess i also thought the super bowl went back further than 1960's 70's he was a patriot hi there. do you like the packers it is the 3rd oldest franchise in the nfl. hi. i love the packers actually. but i don't love how the waiting list for season tickets exceeds 100k names and nearly 30 years. that is just ridiculous. yes that is crazy indeed. they are the only community owned not for profit franchise. that is one aspect i do love about the packers as well. i also think it's funny that in the 2011 super bowl the steelers entered to the song black and yellow by wiz khalifa while the packers came out to the remix by lil wayne green and yellow. i wonder if that was intentional ha. yes that is very funny. the packers are actually named after the indian packing company. wonder how that happened i wonder that as well. but i think it's surprising they've been playing home games at lambeau field since 1957. that's a very long time. yes that is very historic. they have sold out every game in that place since 1960. that is unbelievable. i do love how there's a clock at lambeau that's set 15 minutes early to honor vince lombardi as he always believed if you aren't 15 minutes early you're late. i absolutely love that quote. yes that is a great quote very sentimental. the first team to ever beat the packers was the beloit fairies. must be the packers no lol. ha. that's funny but also embarrassing. speaking of historical facts did you know the first playoff game in the nfl was played on an 80 yard long dirt field back in 1932 the field was actually home to the nhl's blackhawks. wow that is cool. when did they switch to 100 yards the footballers didn't always make so much money in the 60's they were out profited by bowlers. that is so sad considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is. fast forward to today they've come so far in football they're sticking these tracking chips in the players' shoulder pads to record their every move. i'm glad they can afford to do that now. exactly. good point. the formers pats running back green ellis never once fumbled the ball. now that takes serious talent and skill. it kind of reminds of ben roethlisberger. he has the most wins as a qb in the browns' home stadium since they were reintroduced in the league and he plays for the steelers. ha. oh yeah he was great. big ben. espn won an emmy for creating that yellow first down marker. quite a cool creation. that is very cool and innovative. i also think those huge 1100 pound american flags at football games are cool as well although the cost to make them being $50k isn't. holy cow that is expensive. i wonder how much it cost for the iowa football team to pain their locker room pink there is no telling honestly. but on a similar note snoop dog actually wrote a high school fight song for the football team his son plays for that i would like to hear. that is so cool. i wonder what snoop dogg would think of the highest score ever in a football game being 222 0 well it was great talking with you. he probably wouldn't be too happy about it. i wonder if that game was played in one of the 14 of the 25 largest stadiums in the world that are us football teams ha. well it was great chatting with you as well. good question not sure if they had that big of a stadium back in 1916. have a good night. what do you think about the nfl week 5 tips i don't follow the nfl usually until around the playoffs. are you a fan i am a fan my favorite team is the patriots and i will be rooting for them on sunday. do you know much about the packers i've heard that they were named after a company. a bit its not my favorite team but i do know some interesting facts and i heard it was an indean company the team is named after a packing company but it's owned by the community. a non profit company that must make insane amounts of cash. well if its the whole community then that makes things easier but i agree there must be a lot of cash involved and every game is sold out. sold old for decades. i wonder how they charge for tickets. also is there much else to do in green bay on a sunday i havent been there but could be a boring place the first team to beat them was the beloit fairies i wonder who chose that name. the fairiesdid you know that the nfl has no rule against women in the league. i don't think women can meet the qualifications for playing. i wonder whether they could have women in positions like punter and kicker. the women have been cheerleaders. men could be cheerleaders too. yeah but cheerleaders dont get hit by others but a punter or kicker might be a good position you know espn won an emmy for the ceation of the yellor first down line. that yellow line is useful for viewers who get only 11 minutes of action on average. how many minutes of commercials apparently 3 quarters of commercials and barely a quarter of actual gameplay but it sure seems longer than that. the game of football has come a long way. in the 1960s the best bowlers made much more than football stars. nowadays i wonder what the difference is. wow i guess football wasnt that popular back in the 60s you know a running back from the patriots never fumbled a ball in his entire career. the guy must have had incredible hands or special gloves. i bet he was a good choice for fantasy football too. i bet he was probably worth a few points did you know the locker room for the visiting team at the university of iowa is painted pink i guess they're hoping to psych out the opposition. think that could be effective. hey did you ever watch the xfl back in the day it was the one created by vince mcmahon i think i never saw that one. i only watched the regular nfl yes it was created by the person who created the wwe so it's kind of based on wrestling in a way i guess it's coming back which is interesting because i think the nfl could use some competition yes i wonder what they will pay the players pro football players do well now but back in the 60's bowlers made more. yep you're right about that. i don't know how popular will be so i don't know how much money they'll make but it is interesting that the salaries of the sports have changed over time like you mentioned yes some players really deserve the big money like the patriots green ellis who has never fumbled the football his whole nfl career yeah they should definitely pay him a lot of money he's amazing. have you ever watched a game on the television the yellow line that marks the first down is actually something that was developed by espn and they won an emmy for it that is a very cool invention. i thought the super bowl was boring this year but it had to have been better than the georgia tech win 222 0. yep that game would have been a blowout and very boring haha. good on georgia tech though cumberland fans must have been very disappointed that day i cannot imagine were still there by halftime. its funny despite the big salaries in the nfl an engineer usually makes a higher lifetime income i wouldn't think that would happen youre right what do you think about how nfl players treat the cheerleaders though its awful. new orleans won't even let the cheerleaders in the same restaurant as a player. what would they do if a woman ever joined the league yep that's a great point. would the girl have to not meet with the other players in restaurants who knows do you ever watch wrestling by the way i am not a big fan apparently abe lincoln is a good wrestler though yep he was really good at it and so was the famous philosopher plato laugh that is funny. watching it in turkey might be more interesting they douse themselves in olive oil. that sounds really slippery haha. what do you think about macho man's outfit design apparently the same designer made clothes for aerosmith and also jimi hendrix they have some bizarre clothing. i just would not want to arm wrestle cyplenkov that dude is strong. no definitely not. apparently wrestling is very popular though and they have incorporated the moves into a lot of other hand to hand combat systems which is interesting yes i find sumo wrestling in japan interesting those guys do not seem to be the most fit yes i could see that being very interesting to watch. they should use the tracking chips from the nfl and put them on wrestlers to better understand how they do their moves do you like wrestling not really but i hear a wrestler has the biggest muscled hands in the world wo. in turkey they lather themselves in oil and then they wrestle wow sounds really slippery. macho man randy savage used to be as football payers before he started wrestling nice. even abe lincoln was a wrestle hall of famer lincoln the president was yup he only lost one match out of 300 wow impressive. there used to be octopus wrestling matches as a sport wow that is pretty cruel n my opinion i know that was back in the 40s and 60s in the west coast wow. plato was also a professional wrestler. i cannot see him being anything else but a philosopher though i know that was before he became interested in philosophy cool. same with neil degrasee tyson he was a champion at harvard wow. do you like football i do. did you know snoop dog wrote a song for his son's high school team cool. u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink is that supposed to have some kind of effect on them no idea. do you know bowlers made more than football players in the 60s i guess it was a much more popular sport back in the day yes i guess that might explain it. nice chatting with you. so you familiar at all with wrestling i used to watch it regularly (that is tv wrestling) years ago but haven't seen it in awhile. did you know abraham lincoln is in the wrestling hall of fame because he only lost once out of 300 matches i find that amazing. it is surprising to say the least. i used to sell coca cola at pro wrestling matches when i was 12. of course it was fake. wrestling can be entertainment or true competition. i've got a friend who was a wrestler (not professional but still) and he always preferred the term scripted. tell him it was fake and he's liable to body slam ya and say did that feel fake to you lol. my brother used to wrestle in high school course he was the sports guy in our family so he did about every sport imaginable. i saw video of hulk hogan caused hearing damage to john stossel by slapping his huge hands to stossel's ear at the same time. they put on a show and wear costumes. macho man's wrestling gear was designed by a guy who designed clothes for aerosmith. wow i can see that. you look at 80s rockers and 80s wrestlers and their costumes are so flamboyantly similar. did you ever meet anyone famous while selling cola at events there was a wrestler named gorgeous george who was semi famous year's ago. even plato wrestled before he decided to start writing smart things. believe it or not i know a bit about gorgeous george he's the guy who really defined being a heel going around calling people peasants and trying to be the daintiest wrestler he could having a valet spray perfume on the other wrestlers and the audience. hilarious stuff well i met him one evening when he toured to wrestle in my home town (oklahoma city). he is sort of like ali and dieon sanders who made themselves more famous by far out behavior. great marketing of self. football did some marketing to go from paying less than top bowlers in 1960 to salaries today. yeah i've heard about that. i've been told back then bowling was a way bigger deal than it was now they even had celebrity bowling shows and stuff. seems unfair that bowlers made more considering football is more dangerous injury wise. did you know there's actually no rule in the nfl barring women from being football players if they pass the requirements that is. i doubt that we will see any female in the game except maybe for a kicker. i love the yellow line marking the line to reach for a first down that espn developed. yeah it's amazing how detailed they can get with the graphics on football games nowadays. i remember back when it was just one guy (usually madden) and he had to draw in the white line pointing to everything. (and you got the guy going here.) hehe. so did you play any sports when you were younger i played football in high school. but i was a back up at qb and only got on the field as a corner back on defense. i never saw anything as debilitating as the pink visitor's room at iowa university. yeah isn't that a trip pink has a psychological effect on people. they say they did a study where the turned a weight room pink and found the lifters suddenly couldn't lift as much as they normally could. me like i said i was never much a sports player but my brother got a football scholarship to college. that's great for you brother and for your parents. i have heard that about the effects of pink walls. when i was on our jv we played the varsity of another school and lost 74 0 which does not compare to the highest score by georgia tech of 222 0 oh man can't imagine what a blow to one's self esteem losing 222 to zero would be. especially crazy considering the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay. i think after the first 100 points you'd be like uh can we just forfeit please lol no doubt about it. i think in our blow out they let the clock run continuously even after incomplete passes. did you watch the 2 of the 32 nfl teams square of in the super bowl last sunday no i missed it. heard a lot people say it wasn't the most exciting of games though. many were even ragging on maroon 5 for playing the half time show. hey get this do you know they put chips in the players shoulder pads and the football to track movements neat huh technology continues to change our lives. that game is usually on the first sunday of february and this year was no exception. some of the rules to play football are pretty strict. did you know for instance if you're a cheerleader for the saints you're forbidden from eating at the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they happen to show up in the middle of their meal they gotta leave guess they're serious about the no fraternizing rule. i read that those chips are also in the football so they can tract the dimensions of forward passes and other things. yeah it's probably helpful for keeping all the players stats up to date. did you know patriots rb benjarvus has never fumbling the football in his nfl career that's pretty impressive considering how fast it can travel and all the other pressures. sure is. by the way i know track from tract. just a type. nice talking with you. do you like wrestling i'm not a huge fan of it but part of it is due to that i don't understand all the logistics. what about you i used to watch it back before it exploded in poplularity in the 90s. did you know that plato lead a professional wrestling career before becoming a famous pholospher maybe something about wrestling made him philosophical. abe lincoln was also well known for wrestling i never knew that about abe. i'm going to have to look that up. he's actually in the wrestling hall of fame because he only lost 1 in 300 matches i never ever heard that about him. he was pretty tall though so he probably had some good leverage. the turkish national sport is oil wrestling where men douse themselves in olive oil and wrestle. that's kind of different.and odd at the same time. lol that also sounds dangerous which might be why it's not super popular yes. the man who designed macho man's wrestling gear was also the same guy who designed clothes for a lot rock stars like jimi hendrix and aerosmith. he must have known what material to use. do you know who denis cyplenkov is i've never heard of him. who is he he's a bodybuilder and arm wrestling champion which is aided by the fact that his hands are the largest and most densely muscled in the world nice. did you know that the university of iowa's vistors locker room was painted pink that's either got to be a result of psychology or that's the color that was on sale lol former patriots running back benjarvus green ellis never fumbled the ball once during his nfl career. impressive indeed. that's an impressive feat for just a season let alone a whole career. i agree. in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of the day. that was before espn came up with the nifty yellow first down line though. that's worth an emmy if you ask me i agree. it comes in handy when we're watching the actual 11 minutes of live gameplay per game. the embedded chips in the footballs and shoulder pads also help with that yes. we'll be seeing some kind of graphic following around the chips. lol it's been fun chatting. are you a football fan i watch football every now and then but i think the xfl is just a bad idea regular football players are injured enough without adding extreme stuff to it. yeah i think the xfl is a bad idea as well. football is pretty extreme in my opinon. well since the found was vince mcmahon it really is not a surprise he would try to start something like xfl. guess he wanted to try his hand at other sports. vince mcmahon is hilarious though. does he still do the wwe or is it no good anymore yeah he is still doing wwe and when he retires which he should have done already since he is 73 his son in law will take over and i do not think it will be any better under him. he's 73 wholly molly i'm not a huge fan of shane though is his son in law still triple h yeah still hhh shane is alright he runs the smackdown brand while his sister runs the raw brand and smackdown is actually much better than raw at least for now. interesting you know a long time ago i met hogan chris benoit miss elizabeth macho man mr. perfect at a bar in baltimore the marriot hotel bar. i have pictures with all of them the only one that isn't dead is hogan. yeah what happened to chris benoit was crazy he was one of my favorite wrestlers when i was younger until he decided to go crazy. yeah i feel bad for him. nash and hall were there too. i can't remember if this was a wwc or wwf event. more than likely it was wcw they were pretty big at that time. yeah it was pretty cool. i'm fairly certain it was wcw because hogan was behind the bar acting like he had all of these important phone calls. i still try to keep up with wwe but it has really fallen off lately the attitude era was the amazing back in the day but now they have the pg era and it is just really bad sometimes. i don't have time for it anymore. what ever happened to eric bischoff he managed raw for a short time but he is not really around any more i think he still works fopr wwe but he is a higher up now interesting. i thought he was funny. my favorite was razor ramon (scott hall) but he is really messed up now. yeah scott hall was pretty bad but recently diamond dallas page has gotten him started on his training and helped him get straightened out a lot. i saw that special on that. pretty cool stuff. i think he needed some type of transplant too. yeah he did but wwe has gone away from actual wrestling and stunts and more toward entertainment the wwe does not even call them wrestlers anymore they are called superstars or entertainers part of the reason the pg era is so bad. interesting i didn't even know about this. it sounds awful now. well nice chatting with you. do you like the nfl yes i like the nfl what do you think about the redskins mascot though you think it's racist i think it could be worst idk what do you think yeah it's tough because i can see why it's racist but on the other hand i can see why it's been that way for a long time and maybe it's not i just don't know lol for sure you have a valid point. do you have a favorite team of the 32 nfl teams well i really like the patriots myself what about you i think tom brady is awesome he is very good. what do you think about the saints well i don't like the fact that they treat their cheerleaders poorly but i'm sure they use tracking chips for players on the field i wonder if they use those same chips to track the locations of their cheerleaders right it is sexist. i am sure they do lol. engineers who made those chips make more than most players do over their life lol you're right about that. i just don't know why you would need to know the balls rotational speed it seems like just knowing the players locations and speed would be enough for sure but they need to be all high tech now. do you watch college football at all time to time. i also watch some high school because my friend's son plays it would be cool if snoop dogg made my friend's son a theme song for his football team lol i would like that. i am an iowa hawkeye fan they paint the visiting locker room pink i heard about that that's pretty funny lol what do you think about the high school football team that is building a 60 million dollar football stadium that is ridiculous. a waste of tax payer money. yep i agree with you. and it only has eighteen thousand people how is that possible right you would think like 100000 oh well they're definitely not making a smart decision. did you know that those huge american flags at football stadiums actually weigh like a thousand pounds that is so much. how do you think they get them up there yeah i've no idea. and i also don't know why someone would pay $50000 for one of those flags that's just too much man i will make them one for 25000. good chatting with you. hi there. i guess i will learn a bit about wrestling so with the xfl do you know much about that it's new to me. not familiar with wrestling at all. although i have read 1 thing i always thought. the sport can either be theatrical or competitive. the theatrical side comes to my mind when i think wrestling. that probably drives people that properly wrestle mad that they are not taken seriously. i like the turkish. they wrestle in olive oil.. seems like a waste of olive oil they should use cheaper stuff like the budget brand from the supermarket. lol the good 'ole wesson oil.. wonder if honest abe wrestled in oil. isn't oil good for a beard so is xfl a mixture of nfl and wrestling or is just a lower form of football don't know. it is a football i believe. to be honest i'm not interested in football so i can't imagine getting excited about another league. there must be some gimmick to get people involved not much of a football fan here either. wasn't aware that there are no rules against females in the football league. maybe that will be the gimmick i'm glad my kids have no interest in football i want my son to be active but not the expense of his brain. it's a tough sport for sure. guess there are risks in all sports though. except maybe swimming. as long as you're not with piranhas. maybe bowling too were we in the sixties it sounds like there was money in it not sure about now. that 's a surprising trivia fact for me. don't even see any bowling alleys anymore. was enjoyable too. a mix of wrestling and bowling would be an interesting concept i could see if vince mcmahon is interested. lol played in the audi field with car racing.. yeah lets get as much involved as possible it's like fusion cooking but for sports. unlike the nfl we could a written rule saying women have to play. the year of woman.why not nice chatting with you.. you too i'm going to grab the olive oil not saying what for cooking or wrestling. have a good day. bye. u2 thank you have you heard of xfl i have. i watched it in 2001 they are relaunching in 2020 and will have 8 cities that will host franchises. i heard. i hope it goes better this time hopefully so it is supposed to be different than the 2001 run. they are going to be looking for players released from the nfl so maybe there will be better playing. yeah. it was interesting i guess with he hate me and all that but the actual football was terrible i think it will be hard to compare to the nfl. most people want to watch really good players playing good football. that's true. they'll definitely need to keep some of the entertainment stuff involved to keep people engaged they are trying to get away from the wwe and i think this could come back to hurt them. they need something else to attract viewers especially since the nfl is around. i dunno. i kind of agree with getting away from the wwe but only if they can replace that with something entertaining. it's a fine line right they will definitely need that entertainment factor. yeah. the list of cities is interesting. nothing in the midwest i think they are signing with united to use some of the stadiums. i guess they are looking for cities that will have a larger fan base. what do you mean by united the united league soccer. oh i'm not familiar with that. is that what mls is known as the united has a lot of good teams. atlanta united is one of them. oh cool. the only united i know is manchester ) hopefully they will be able to work out the scheduling issues for when soccer football and xfl overlap. yeah. they could offset the nfl and xfl seasons as a start. help with scheduling and attendance that is a good idea. that can help with the wear and tear on the field as well. yeah not a bad idea overall there is enough funding for them for 5 years so hopefully they can become figure something out and make it become successful. yeah i wouldn't mind an alternative to the nfl. hopefully it works out i hope so too. we will see. hi how are you i am well thank you. do you enjoy the nfl by any chance i do like the nfl. i also know that derwin james is going to wing the rookie defensive player of the year so it is pretty much an easy choice at this point. congratulations to him. he deserves it. i can't there are 32 teams and we end up with the patriots in the superbowl again. that's upsetting. you're not a pats fan do you like the nfl no. i don't like the cheating scandals and even more than that i'm just sick of seeing them in the superbowl. it's boring at this point. i do like the nfl. did you know that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game on average wow that's not a lot. who is your favorite team i am a bears fan. they actually had a good season this year until that playoff game messed it all up. how about you me too. it was a nice year. i was shocked they did that well. since our draft pick went to oak i wanted them to do well since our draft position would be unaffected. yes they did very well. mack was a great addition. did you know that the nfl has no written rules prohibiting female players seems like they are trying not to be sexists but the objectification of their cheerleaders seem counter to that goal. yes it does. i know that saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as players and if they are there first an a player enters they have to leave. that's very upsetting. yeah. i wonder how much an older white guy being owner affects that tom benson has a conservative viewpoint. i'm not sure but it's crazy to me. who cares if they eat at the same place i did not know that they use tracking chips in players shoulder pads and footballs. i wonder why they use replays to make calls then i know. i was watching the australian open and was amazed at the timeliness and speed of their challenges. seems like the nfl has a ways to go. that seems to be the case. were you aware that espn created the yellow line that we see onscreen showing the marker for first down i think i knew that. i thin they won an emmy for it. yes they did. i can't imagine watching a game without it. since we discussed the patriots earlier benjarvus green ellis never fumbled a football his entire career. i don't know how that is possible. i don't know why he is not employed then. i love the yellow line. i remember telling my wife that they had guys move it on everyfirst down hoping the players didn't trip over it. ha ha that's funny. i can't believe that in the 60's bowlers made more than nfl players. i didn't know it was ever that popular. right nice chatting with you. so do you watch much football i enjoy watching nfl from time to time. they have 32 teams. i do like the nfl. my favorite team is one of the afc teams the baltimore ravens. they have a 17 week season that runs from early september to later in december. i wonder if they are pretty tired by the end of the season. i would think. maybe those fancy sensors and tracking chips they have embedded in their shoulder pads could give some insight. did you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live play. i didn't know that. it certainly seems much longer. the nfl is coming up on a 100 year anniversary in not too long. they started in 1932. wow i didn't know it had been that long. the biggest game is at the end of the season called the super bowl. right. and it's normally played on the first sunday in february. it's played by one of the two leagues in the nfc and afc the super bowl is pretty amazing. it's such a spectacle. hard to believe the first nfl playoff game was played on a dirt field. i read that that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player doesn't surprise me. many nfl careers are quite short. the league does generate a ton of money though. even college football is about the cash. 14 of the 25 largest stadiums belong to college football teams. wow thats crazy. i read something strange about the new orleans saints. apparently the cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as the football players that hardly seems fair. i guess it is what it is though. i find it interesting that those huge american flags can weigh up to 1100 pounds. no way. that's a lot. it even says that if they are already eating there and a football player walks in they are required to leave. seems strange. for sure. i like football but also chess too. do you play i think it would be interesting to see the 3 player chess game. i actually have never played. i did see though that there are more possible moves in a game of chess than there are atoms in the known universe. do you think thats true i find that hard to believe. i've been playing since i was a kid but don't play too often anymore. i never knew that each pawn used to have it's own name. i read that the president of the world chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens. lol that's just crazy. some magicians are quite good at chess. i saw that the chess grandmaster judit polgar beat a family friend at age 5 without looking at the board. crazy. that is crazy. well it's been nice chatting with you. yes good chatting with you as well hello have you heard of the redskins before hi how are you the redskins a football team yeah the same one they have the 13th pick it seems does that position them well for the following season 13th doesnt seem bad or good. i think its good it can be worse i hear ther are in the lookout of a great qb being in position 13th might ruin their chances i guess they can trade up if they need to. who was/is the current qb alex something not sure about that they do draft jonathan allen last season his a great player but they still need others who i j allen is he the next greatest qb not sure his positiion he is #17 of the team though theres also sean tyler another promosing talen i dont follow football much. what do you think of women in the nfl i think they would be at a dissadvantage theres no rule against them paying but it would be kind of unfair and dangerous for them yeah i agree. not much point really. what does it prove maybe as a kicker but still what does that prove maybe as a kicker yeah they should have their own devision now thats something i would watch i think that it would be good to start the game at the high school level build interest and a number of players. then see how things go. maybe some day so do you like to play chess i used to play a bit. i was an interesting game. now i dont. you i like it a board with 64 squares and a 8x8 grid there are a lot of moves and strategies so cool game yeah it is a simple game with complex strategy. that is the best part. easy to learn rules but no limit to the possibilities. there are more games in the game that atoms in the known universe how crazy is that that sounds about right. i cant imagine any two games going the same way. anyway great chat. i think im going to play chess now its been great chatting with you as well have a nice morning. hi how are you what do you think of the game of chess i think it is a really complex game. there are more moves in chess than atoms in the universe it is complex. i played a bit when i was young. i don't play now. i think it takes tremendous concentration. there's a grandmaster who was able to win a game without looking at the board at age 5 man some people just have a gift for the game. it really requires a certain mindset. some people think math is related to chess ability but i don't think so. a 2007 study discovered a negative correlation between iq and chess skill that would make sense. i think that iq tests do not capture the intelligence of chess. what do you think of chess being invented by aliens that is a silly idea. the board is simple. the pieces are simple. the complexity comes from the possibilities not from aliens. why would the aliens give us chess maybe the chess grandmaster knows something we do not yes maybe he does or maybe he is an alien trying to use reverse psychology to throw us off the scent. lol are you into football i sometimes watch football. more than chess. lol i'm sure a lot of people do. did you know espn won an emmy for the yellow first down line yeah i heard that. i guess they must have been the first to superimpose graphics on the field. yeah they completely recreate the playing surface. its pretty cool yes i see a lot of graphics on the field now. quite useful for the viewers. football has come a long way. financially as well. professional bowlers use to make twice as much as players i think the football players made very little so i don't know how much the bowlers made. anyway great chat. i wonder if a pink locker room actually has an effect on players i doubt it. well maybe a small one. anyway great chat. you as well have a great day. are you a patriots fan or a fan of trump i'm more of a patriots fan than a fan of donald trump. trump holds kraft belichick and brady in high regard. he has called them winners in the past yes trump like's to associate himself with anything in the popular culture that is a winner. but the pats seem self made unlike the donald. the patriots also know how to conduct themselves as winners and come back from behind. yes i see the parallel between the falcons patriots superbowl and trump's victory in 2016. i think that comparison is apt. espn does not favor the patriots nearly as much as fox favors trump hmmm. yes. i never knew that espn was against the patriots but they did really pump up deflategate. funny that espn is seen as a rival of the pats when they are based in connecticut. i think deflategate was just a big distraction to other issues around the country sports new can be a big distraction. did you know that the patriots were the nfl's whitest team doesn't surprise me given where they are located i would assume that them being white is just coincidence than someone contrived. i have been a big fan of the patriots since brady starting playing i'm amazed by brady. he's a pretty amazing story. i don't really get the patriots hate (if there is such a thing) across the country. i think it goes to the fact the the patriots under bellichick have won over 20 post season games and are always on top season after season yes. i have joined the bandwagon as a fan. i have to admit that i wanted the rams to win the patriots first superbowl though. i was so mad when they were down to the falcons a couple years back at halftime by 25 points. i never thought they would come back probably the most amazing comeback in superbowl history. in fact i don't know if there's been a comeback in nfl history that has been so epic. atlanta will never forget for sure.lol where do you stand was it more of an atlanta meltdown or a new england come back comeback for sure. do you follow the patriots good morning. i follow the nfl very closely. i am sick of the patriots. hard to believe they were once lovable underdogs this century. now they are the favorite at every turn the owner gifted a jersey to our president yea i know tom brady keeps a maga hat in his locker during interviews. bob kraft and trump are good friends. kraft is a member at mar a lago. he does thats new to me cray how prior to 2001 season they never won a title and now they are the team with the most superbowl titles under their belt yup do you watch game of thrones at all i thought it was hilarious the author called the pats the lannisters of the nfl. i do watch it and that makes sense lol the pats have dominated the league for many years now it is crazy how dominant they have been. 15 afc east titles in 17 years in a sport with that much free agency is just unfathomable. 15 out of 17 no kidding.. that is amazing i dont think that will happen again in the history of the sport yea i would agree. we will not see that again. i did not know until recently gillette stadium is equidistant from boston and providence. always thought it was much closer to boston. i love that stadium its the home stadium to our team did you hear about superbowl 46 and how the pats let the giants score a touchdown yes i remember that well. bold strategy but the giants won anyway. yeah the giants didnt want to score but they ended up scoring i wonder if bill belichick was the coach he was the coach for that game. he has been the coach for the last 8 patriots super bowl appearances which is insane.. he is a great coach i guess part of the succes of the patriots is thanks to him did you know the patriots also hold the record for more superbowl losses in the nfl yes i think they are actually tied with the poor bills ( yeah they hold the record with the bills but at least we also hold the record of more superbowl wins not sure how many the bills have won yup goes to show you how good you can be if you are fundamentally sound like the pats are. for example benjarvus green ellis never fumbled once in his whole career. what a stat. it is an amazing stat he must be the only one in nfl history skilled player he retired back in 2011 right that sounds about right. a fun fact that not too many people know the browns last playoff win in 1995 was actually with belichick as the head coach. belichick is a great coach a leyend not only for the patriots then anyways its been great chatting with you lots of cool facts thanks it was great chatting with you too. did you see the patriots win the superbowl yes did you know that at one point in 2001 they were the underdogs the game now is amazing i did not because it seems like they've been a dynasty forever now. did you know that george rr martin called the patriots the lannisters of the nfl i think that's fitting. haha tat is funny at this point they surely inspure envy and suspition with the scandals. but yes at one point brady was the 199th pick can you guess the year that's super shocking. no what year was it 2000 he came from university of michigan. funny with a democratic state trump loves them because they are 'winners' not for much longer the stars are getting too old. everyone also forgets that they are tied with the bills for the most super bowl losses. right and gillette stadium is actually in foxborough mass about an hour from boston so its not quite a 'boston' team they sure claim it. did you know that in the 1960's top bowler's made more money than top football players that's so strange. i love those weird facts. like the giant american flags weigh 1100 pounds and cost 50000 to make. wow. i was not aware of that. that's crazy. are you familiar with benjarvus green ellis from the patriots no tell me more about him he never fumbled a football in his entire career and he was a running back. i don't know how that's possible. that sounds impossible. nearly as impossible is that th patriots have either won or lost by 3 or 4 points in all 6 tries those are close games. here's a fact about high scoring games. the highest scoring football game was in 1916 between georgia tech and cumberland and the score was 222 0. that is funny poor cumberland. last playoff for cleveland browns was 1995 against the patriots i'm not surprised. they were so excited when they won their first game this year because it had been so long. have you heard about the university of iowa's locker room no is it cool they painted the visiting teams room pink. i'm assuming that's some kind of psychological warfare. oh no. that would make me want to win more. atleast the stadium didnt cost 60 million to build like a highschool in allen texas that's insane. i wonder how they got that money. especially if it's a public school. hey there do you like the new england patriots and what do you think about tom brady i don't really care for the patriots. nor for tom brady. what do you think i do like the patriots personally. they do win all the time. do you like game of thrones the author of game of thrones does not like the patriots apparently lol i haven't watched much of game of thrones or read the books. why didn't he like them well i don't know exactly but i do watch the game of thrones and he says the patriots are like the lannisters. the lannisters are definitely the bad guys in that show lol yikes that is a very unflattering comparison. i think the patriots are the yankees of football. everyone loves to hate them. haha yes i can agree with you there. do you like the buffalo bills by the way they are equivalent to the new york patriots in terms of super bowl losses haha i haven't ever heard of them actually. i'm a bit football illiterate. is there a coach that is known as like the best in the league yes i think that's bill belichick i think he's the best in the league and it is an amazing record. he is the most winningest coach in the nfl postseason with 21 wins. wow that is quite a lot of wins. what team does he coach for right now he coaches the new england patriots. and i think he'll be there coach again next year. if they win again next year that would be insane. what do you think about the cleveland browns by the way i can't say that i know much about them. they are sort of one of those teams you hear about in passing but aren't any good so you dont' really give them a second thought. yeah that's true. i guess their last playoff win was back in 1995. that seems like so long ago. wow that is almost a quarter of a centuary ago. i know right. it doesn't seem that long ago but it kind of was lol did you hear about the pink locker room you know the one painted that way by the university of iowa that is totally something i could see happening in iowa. they love to razz opposing teams. i wonder if it works though i would play a lot better if i were put in a pink locker room lol what about you i would find it hilarious. i'm sure it was supposed to be some sort of play on pink being a girls color. who knows with it being iowa though. yeah that's true. have you gone bowling recently apparently bowling in the 60s the top players made more than top football players that's completely the opposite of now btw it probably has a lot to do with the longevity of the career of a bowler vs a football player. it seems like football players have such a short career due to all the injuries. i think so. they need to be wise with their money so that it lasts them their whole life just in case they get injured. did you hear about espn winning an emmy are you on facebook used to be but i got fed up with their shenanigans. how long have you been on since early days i was one of the first in 2006 were you at least 13 years old then yes much older than that unfortunately i heard that myspace said no to the chance to buy fb for $75 mil in 2005. oops. mark zuckerberg seems to be digging himself a big hole at facebook nowadays with all his cash he could just buy an island and live there without worries. have you heard about the bk promotion i would unfriend and refriend to get many whoppers. i didn't hear that one. can you tell me more about it burger king had a promotion where you'd get a free whopper if you unfriended 10 people on fb. not sure what the point was. spread hate for your fast food cravings how would they know did they run the promotion on the radio i guess you would have to show them on your phone or something. maybe there was a link on the website. does anyone listen to radio anymore seems like youtube is the only game around. all it takes to make one is a razorblade and a pencil. if that radio got people likes on fb it would be popular again. do you know what cancon is i don't. what is it canadian content. in canada 40% of music must be canadian in origin. rush. more rush. i bet they play a lot of justin bieber he is canadian i think. yeah he's canadian. are you an nfl fan i absolutely love nfl. i am watching game now what game is it the patriots denver oakland. i hope they combine for the most points in a game tonight got some money riding on it eh good luck. hi how are you doing today great and yourself i'm doing great. do you use facebook i do. i never knew about the like button being illegal in germany. do you use facebook i don't. never really saw the appeal but i understand it helps people stay in touch. myspace made a blunder. how much money did they miss out on they could've bought it for 75 million and now it's worth 104 billion. do you watch football i sometimes watch. it's an interesting sport. do you watch american football soccer or rugby i didn't know an emmy could be won for a line lol i watch american football around playoffs and the world cup for soccer. i guess the line was an big breakthrough for the game. i like it when i watch on tv. what do you think about the university of iowa having a pink locker room for the visiting team i would say that it's a cheap ploy to put the opposition in a softer mood. can't imagine it works now. do you prefer to watch the games on tv or listen to them on the radio prefer the tv. the radio is great for talk shows and for music. and maybe the occasional weekly news program in classical latin. i would love to find the am station where you can hear the jupiter radio storms. that's crazy. probably better than most of the top 40 these days. the kids have their preferences though. i guess jupiter storms are old school. i wonder if classic radio dramas could ever make a comeback they say everything eventually comes back in style right i wonder if that's true in an age of video. maybe researchers and professors will take an interest. maybe that's something that someone at harvard can re develop and look into and test it with harvard students much like mark zuckerberg did with facebook put the zuck on it. see what happens. maybe get burger king involved with a promotion for a free whopper. burger king doesn't need the promotion they already give enough money to facebook with their advertisements true. i enjoyed chatting. me too. have a great day. bye. good morning are you a football fan hi there. i really don't enjoy it but i went to a big football college in the sec so i'm familiar enough haha. the sec sure loves their football. the schools have to bring in some much money from those games. they do mostly from the broadcasting rights. the behind the scenes action can be pretty interesting too for example the university of iowa's visitor's locker room is painted pink. i wonder if they thought it would give them an advantage psychologically i can't see that working though. if anything it's going to give the visiting team more motivation right i wonder if teams of the variations of football in other countries try similar tactics. i think at the highest level of sports that athletes are so tuned in that the only thing that might throw them off is their own mistake or the refs. yes for example former patriots qb benjarvus green ellis never fumbled in his nfl career. that's an amazing stat and he had one of the best nicknames ever the law firm. that's certainly an interesting one. was it a reference to his offensive abilities it was because his name sounded like a law firm haha. the law firm of ben jarvis green ellis. yeah that would make for a confusing on air name as a broadcaster if people thought it was an advertisement especially on the radio haha. yes it would it wasn't used a ton just to bring a little humor into the broadcast. it would probably read easier on a platform like facebook i don't think they have a character limit for names. i've never really explored that my name isn't very long to begin with so i never ran into that issue. the site does have some interesting quirks. for example the primary color is blue because mark zuckerberg is red green colorblind i remember an nfl game where the two teams wore red and green jerseys. a lot of people who suffered from that complained because they could not tell who were on what team. that's funny maybe it's part of why a home team wears white a lot of the time. i don't think many ncaa teams have green as a color although a lot have red like ohio state. yeah this was a special game where they were testing color rush jerseys that were primarily one color. that's why so many people had trouble because there were no breaks in the color or noticeable logos. i guess they make some choices to make things easier on the viewers. for example espn actually won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line shown on tv. that was a great invention that made watching the game a lot easier. it was fun talking football with you have a great day. good afternoon. hi there. i just learned that a wealthy board member of the university of virginia wanted to sponsor a shoe shopping day for female staff and some women were offended. virginia just cannot get a break. isn't that the truth. what was the reason behind a female only shopping spree i hope it wasn't nefarious it was to celebrate his mom's 102 birthday. the women objected because they want to choose the groups they associate with and this trip would jam them together arbitrarily. interesting. the guy had to resign from the board. he just wanted to express generosity and have some people have some fun. it was a strange turn of events. like you said nothing these days about the commonwealth of virginia surprises me any more. that's amazing speaking of shopping for shoes stephon marbury promoted a line of shoes that cost $15 and took no money for the endorsement. starbury is a good dude he played here in phoenix and did a lot of good stuff in the community and was pretty selfless. this does not surprise me and i think i heard about it a while back. thought he was still playing in china i am in ahwatukee myself. some shoes are safety equipment. i have known men who wore steel toed shoes to protect against heavy items being dropped. for sure very valuable in the construction industry. i bet some of those shoes start to smell pretty bad after a few years of work. undoubtedly. they say that dry tea bags will absorb the odor. i wonder how long it takes. i guess there's always a double use for everything every made in the world. i wonder how these things are discovered.. good point. did someone drop a tea bag and then did not notice it and one shoe smelled better compared to the other one right. i guess we'll never know if it was science or accidents shoes are pretty weird when you think about how diverse they are and pretty much everyone has several pairs and types nfl wide receiver steve smith would leave his pair of cleats on the field after each game to remind people of the homeless who don't have shoes. another good dude athlete. i remember this gesture and how he didn't make a big deal about it until the media caught on. i just heard about it recently. i did see him do some interviews and he came across as a good guy. i also read that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes. another one of those how do the measure that did someone walk a mile in someone's 5000 year old shoes great point and they couldn't have been comfortable. yes that's right. years ago shoes were more for function and there is some of that now like the steel toed ones. however they are much more for fashion now than they used to be. fashion for sure and the prices for some are crazy i've seen designer sneakers for $500 that's ridiculous. it sure is. when our kids moved out i put in shoe racks and we now have a shoe room for my wife in what used to be a bedroom. nice conversation. thanks. hi. do you know a lot about shoes a decent amount. what about you do you have a shoe preference not really. i do have a problem though and maybe you can help me out. my feet sweat really bad and they make my shoes smell really stinky. do you know of any tricks or tips i can do to help get rid of the unpleasant odor you can place dry tea bags in shoes and they will absorb the bad smell. for real. thank you so much. i was about to pass out from the stench. i wonder how they know that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes. they must have tested them. leather shoes can be really resilient. i bet. pro ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. i bet that gets expensive. yes but if they are professional i think the ballet company pays for the shoes. do you prefer functional shoes or decorative fashionable shoes or both i'm a mixture of both. seems like the big money i spend for nice shoes ends up being a waste though because then i don't wear the shoes. lol ha ha. i like to buy moderately expensive high quality shoes on sale because they last longer. did you know that nfl player steve smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness about homeless people without shoes that's pretty cool of him to do that. i feel terrible when i see homeless people. i can't even imagine what goes through their minds every day. same. i wonder if he raises money to buy shoes to give away he must. i'll have to look it up. sephon marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed for $15 and he wasn't paid to endorse them. i wonder if those were some kind of shoes for charity as well and that's why he did it for free i wonder. do you prefer american football or soccer or both i prefer football over soccer. lol i prefer soccer. i especially enjoy watching the world cup games both the men's and women's world cups. i'll watch the world cup games. i wonder why americans call it soccer but the rest of the world calls it football probably because elsewhere in the world they don't really watch american football. rugby is popular around the world though. what is your favorite american football team my favorite team is the steelers. do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was i think it was in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 222 0. crazy. no mercy for the other team. p did you know that professional bowlers in the 1960s made 2 times more than current football stars bowling must've been real popular then. wow. it was along with baseball and horse racing. thanks for chatting. sure have a good day. you too. i love shoes in fact i have a collection of them nice are they as good as the 5000 years old ones i dont think so lol but they look nice that i can tell you nice ). did you know ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week no i didnt they must spend a fortune on shoes good thing i dont like ballet lol yeah they must. how to you keep your shoes free of smells i use a spry and also dry tea bags its a great way to absorb all those bad smells highly recommended nice good to know. do you know who steve smith is no not really who is he an nfl player who always leaves his cleats in the field after the game to raise awareness about homelessness oh so thats him i remember now his a wide receiver and not only a great player but it seems like a great person as well yeah he is doing what he loves while doing something great for the community i agree so do you also know the player benjarvus green ellis yeah he is the guy that never fumbled a football in his career yeah the same one he played for the patriots his one of the best players i have seen at least on the rb position. yeah that is amazing. u of iowa locker room is apparently pink the visitors one thats funny i wonder how the other teams take that its hard to be tough in a pink room i know it is supposed to be some kind of distraction i think i wonder if the tactic works the other team might get angry because it seems a bit insulting anyways back in the 60s bowlers made more money than football players yeah i know. do you know who the wealthiest presidents of the us are im guessin trump jfk and jefferson actually trump is not in there bu washington is oh i see thats interesting trump is rich as hell or so it seems that way. hello there do you watch much television i love tv. how about you. whats your favorite show. yeah same here i love tv. i would have to say either seinfeld or the simpsons are my all time favs how about you never cared for seinfeld myself. i love the simpsons. did you know there is only one episode where bart isnt in the show or mentioned. i think i have heard about that before but pretty sure i have never seen that one. i have seen a lot of epeiodes of the simpsons. i dont remember seeing that one either. yeah i think simpsons should have done like seinfeld and quit while they were still very funny i think after season 10 it started going downhill. i never really thought seinfeld was funny. i liked cramer he was funny. i could wathc the simpsons anytime. homer is always funny. yeah the simpsons is just classic. have you ever seen pokemon i have not actually. i do know there are over 750 episodes. thats about 50 a year for 16 years. it was pretty popular. yeah isn't that just crazy how many there are i wonder how they keep coming up with new material after all those shows. well i think there are thousands of different pokemon. so they would have no shortage of characters toto make it new. throw in wow well in that case yeah i guess they could just pick a character and make a few shows out of that. dont quote me on that number. i know there are a lot of them though. were you a that 70s show fan yeah i really like that show when it first came out have you ever seen it yeah i thought it was pretty good. i guess they remade it over in the uk. it was canceled after 10 episodes. i heard it bombed over there when they tried yeah i wonder why/ i guess it just didnt translate well. they remade the show verbatim so it was exactly what we saw here. or maybe the actors werent very good. yeah that could be it i know the actors really made the show over here. i know i enjoyed it over here. almost as much as my son loves thomas the tank. yeah i heard that show has had some big names narrating. anyways it's been good talking with you i hope you have a good day. good morning. good morning. how are you so did you get a chance to watch the winter olympics at all last year yes i watched some of it. my favorite is the ice skating. i like the singles and the couples equally. i like adam rippon. i didn't get a chance to watch a ton of it. i have small kids so i watch a lot of cartoons most nights but i did get to watch some. i'm not a huge skating fan but i don't mind it whenever the olympics come on. yeah adam rippon did pretty amazing. you would never guess that these amazing people are so nervous. they look so polished like they never got scared. yeah it's true. they do look real calm. i feel like i would be freaking out if i were in that position. i would fall flat on my face. i did not know that he was gay. that must put him in a position to help other people who are gay to be cool with it. yeah. it seems like he used his sports platform to talk about the difficulties of being gay and the difficulties that a lot of younger people face. yes there is so much bullying that kids go through if they are different. yeah. i always worry about bullying when my kids get older. i know you can't protect your kids forever but it's hard to see others treated badly because they may look or act different. you have to stand behind them that's for sure. my son is gay but he never got bullied because he came out after high school. i have always stood behind him anyway. in high school the other kids were scared of him because he was a fighter. well that's one way to deal with bullying. haha. i think it is very important to stand behind your kids and let them know you love them no matter what. kids need family support. as long as they are being themselves they will learn to stand up to bullying. most bullies are cowards anyway. that's true. i was looking at some interesting facts here. i didn't realize that the three wealthiest presidents were jfk washington and jefferson. but i guess the two oldest owned massive amounts of land i'm sure. there was plenty of land to go around in those days. and the kennedys got rich on irish whiskey. i am from massachusetts. lol i guess you would know then. haha. i just went to a museum in virginia not too long ago about the early settlers and they pretty much just gave away land for free back then to anyone who would come and settle there. those were the days. yes. i wish i was there. that was a great enticement for people to come from europe. but it was hard living in those days. not so easy to settle a new country. no. it was very hard. we got to walk around the old settlements and they definitely had to work very hard and pretty much everything they had was from the land they lived off of. no grocery stores or macys. haha still it must have been worth it because a lot of people came. they didn't have any entertainment either. no television and no simpsons. yeah what did they do with all their free time. haha. they definitely had a strong work ethic. they had to or they wouldn't survive. they probably didn't have free time. sunday mornings but they all went to church. you couldn't be lazy or you wouldn't eat. well i am going to head out here. it was very nice chatting with you today. thank you have a great day. don't work too hard. i'll try not too. do you watch television at all i do. i like comedies how about you i like comedies and dramas. not big on pokemon though me neither. but some people must like it since they made 750 episodes. i guess kids will watch anything. have you watched that 70s show i have. i heard it was remade in the uk and got cancelled. i'm not surprised. the show was very american. sometimes it works well the other way. three's company was based on a uk show. that's true. i didn't realize that. would you watch a show that used chickens to entertain audiences i don't think so. haha. cesar learned about chickens as entertainment in britain. strange because chickens are so tasty. people do a lot of different things for entertainment. do you play video games i used to play. don't play now. what's your favorite system i had an old nintendo. they finally discontinued it in 2003. very popular system even though it had only 54 colors. much better than the gameboy. i wonder if they have video games at the white house if there are kids in the white house sure. trump tends to watch tv a lot. i don't think he plays games. i heard the guest house is bigger than the white house itself. i guess they have a lot of visitors. these days guests are probably getting fast food because of the gov't shut down. that's true. it used to be that the runner up of the election became the vice president. that would never work these days. i imagine a lot of fighting all the time. yeah i can see that. i learned a lot from you thanks for chatting. do you watch a lot of tv i do. i love game shows and sitcoms but i am also a big fan of some cartoons. what cartoons do you like i really like american dad but some of the older episodes of south park are really great. did you know that when they aired their family guy episode they received flowers from the crew of the simpsons i did not it seems like they have a good relationship thats great they are rivals but no need to fight i think it's a pretty well shared opinion in the cartoon world that family guy is a lazy show because so much of its humor is non sequiturs. have you ever watched pokemon i have got to catch them all right seems a bit impossible at this point yes kind of like 'catching' all of the undocumented immigrants as some might put it. did you see any of the president's speech on border security on tv today i did it seems like a waste of money to me nor really worth it do you support trump definitely not. it's odd that he claims he knows how to run a country on the basis that he's a rich businessman and yet he's not even one of the three wealthiest presidents (jfk washington jefferson) yeah i think he is too stuborn and does whatever he wants. his guest house is larger than the white house its hard to believe he's not on that list i guess it's kind of ironic that a man who owns all those hotels lives in a house smaller than his guest house haha. i bet he'd prefer an authoritarian regime where he could be a dictator who's just called a president. yeah i agree it is ironic indeed you know that up untill 1805 the runner up of an election would become vice president... can you imagine hillary clinton as trump's vp now that would be some can't miss entertainment. that would definitely hold the national audience's interest. we would have a civil war almost every week lol its a good thing that has changed now in my opinion trump should use his time to record pop albums instead of trying to build an expensive and useless wall yes the president show on comedy central actually had a christmas special that featured a fake trump holiday album. if he didn't spend so much time on twitter maybe he could release 3 albums like the president of indonesia has while in office that would be a great idea i might buy the album and maybe trump will make it to the top 3 rank with the money of the sales yes that would be one way to make money. did you know that ronald reagan was once rejected for a movie role because he didn't look presidential enough i wish that had happened with voters and trump. that is ironic lol and i hope trump doesn't get re elected. i really don't understand why people vote for him. i hope not. the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana and based on the little i've read about him it seems like he wasn't a very effective leader and the country is still negatively impacted by his time in office. so enough politics and more entertainment did you ever own a nintendo system i did a long time ago and snes too. too bad they stopped making those consoles. yeah they stopped making them back in 2003 its a shame but theres more advanced systems now yes they display far more than the 54 colors the original had. hi how are you well thank you. do you enjoy any sports i enjoy all sports. what about you i especially enjoy football and baseball. do you enjoy any in particular i really enjoy those. i like college and the nfl. football and the nfl are both very popular in the us. 14 of 25 of the largest stadiums belong to college football teams. wow i did not know it was that many. i know michigan and osu have huge stadiums but i am not sure i could name more. maybe oklahoma texas alabama i mean a high school football stadium in texas with 18k seats cost 60 million to build. imagine how much it too to build those big college stadiums. yeah. college teams have huge boosters though. like oregon has phil knight and oklahoma state has t booke pickens. these stadiums sure are a large investment. even the huge american flags alone are 50k a pop that much... holy cow. i wonder how much the pink paint iowa used to paint the visitors locker room cost i wonder if baseball stadiums cost just as much no not in college they do not need the infrastructure that foot ball needs in terms of seating. really i though even college baseball have large stadiums. in any case did you know a typical season uses up to 160k baseballs that many. i went to a big ten school and they had maybe 100 people at the games. it was sparce. really i imagined college baseball to be 3rd only behind football and soccer having at least several hundred to a thousand not at illinois. there was a guy who found $3m in baseball cards in his grandpa's attic. man it seems like forgotten attics are actually treasure troves. while i enjoy baseball it seems they haven't done a good job making it far for women. a 17 year old female pitcher was banned from professional baseball after she struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig banned for that are attics going to be the new storage unit perhaps. on a different note baseball have more fair rules to keep players from making bad choices. for instance if a player catches a baseball in their hat the opposing team gets 3 bases. that would make it more fun. nice chatting with you. are you a fan of football by any chance yes i actually am i am a fan of the patriots what about you i am. bears fan here. were you aware that the patriots had a player that never fumbled the ball his entire career i am aware i became a fan because of him benjarvus green ellis what a great player. that is such a shocking statistic. he was a running back right yeah he was a running back that is correct did you hear about the team that lost by 222 points that was a serious defeat.. i did. it was cumberland that lost. i do not know how it is possible to score that many points in a game. i know. the other team's coach really underperformed or the whole team was underslept apparently. in the 60's bowlers made more than football players. i can't imagine that bowling was ever that popular. or maybe football players didnt earn that much to begin with have you ever been to the university of iowa turns out the visiting team locker room is completely pink. i have not but that's some kind of psychological warfare ha ha. i watch a lot of television even when football is not on. do you it must be it definetely makes you think twice and i do as well i love tv mostly cartoons or animated series though. i like adult animated series like archer and south park. apparently when south park did their family guy episode the simpsons crew sent them flowers which is hilarious. that is hilarious and i love both shows i also like pokemon but mostly the 150 original pokemons. i can't believe there were so many. how many years was it on it's like 750 pokemon episodes and its been around 16 years since it first aired so quite a long time and its still successfull. wow it does not seem like that long. since i mentioned the simpsons earlier there is only one episode where bart does not appear and is not mentioned. with as long as that has been on that's so shocking. i havent seen that episode i might google it later and yeah the simpsons has over 600 episodes. i don't think i have either. that's an insane amount of episodes. did you ever see thomas the tank engine i did my little brother used to love thomas the tank engine i remember it had great narrators. it did. ringo starr george carlin and alec baldwin have all narrated for them.\""
